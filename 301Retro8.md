## Retrospective

Retrospectives are a critical part of Agile, and typically take the form of meetings held by a team at the end of a sprint cycle. To get us acclimated to that process, we will use the format of a retrospectives to guide today’s reflection.

This article gives a nice overview of the role of retrospectives.

Take 10-15 minutes at the end of lab to respond to the following questions, adapted from the article:

## What went well, that I might forget if I don’t write it down?
-I got the new version of pfsense 2.7.1 to load pretty easily and documented it a lot better for reference this time.

## What did I learn today?
-RADIUS and how to set it up in pfsense.

## What should I do differently next time?
-Follow along with the RADIUS demo on pfsense a little better.

## What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?
-How the different authentication services work there are just so many, especially as I am studying for NET+.


Thinking about each of your assignments for the day, reflect on:

## Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
-Work on tomorrow's reading and start taking more demo CompTIA NET+ tests. While going through the CompTIA courseware I studied a lot and went through the practice questions. Once I took the provided test they made the test questions entirely different. They incorporated practical questions not just multiple choice which is more like the actual test I remember I failed. I will be studying very hard for this test it means a lot to me that I pass this.
