## Retrospective 9

Retrospectives are a critical part of Agile, and typically take the form of meetings held by a team at the end of a sprint cycle. To get us acclimated to that process, we will use the format of a retrospectives to guide today’s reflection.

This article gives a nice overview of the role of retrospectives.

Take 10-15 minutes at the end of lab to respond to the following questions, adapted from the article:

## What went well, that I might forget if I don’t write it down?
Even though this in theory this was pretty simple. I did have some issues that ironed themselves out. Raphael did assist me with a weird issue where we had to change the LAN IP address on the pfsense since I lost communication through the GUI but could ping everything fine. I also had to manually set the DNS to 1.1.1.1 to resolve domain names, it was weird.

## What did I learn today?
To be flexible and take my time when explaining things to others while experiencing issues. I kinda hit Raphael with a shotgun blast of information when he first started helping me and had to take a step back.

## What should I do differently next time?
Take my time even when I think things are going to be simple thats when you make stupid mistakes that cost you hours of time.


## What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?
I still struggle with balancing out studying for network+ and focusing on actual class work.

Thinking about each of your assignments for the day, reflect on:

## Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
Reading and going over study material the practical questions in the network plus are no joke.
