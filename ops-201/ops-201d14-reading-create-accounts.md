Confirm Slack, GitHub, Google, OpenAI and Canvas Setup
Whether you’re starting in 102 or you’ve tested into 401, let’s confirm your accounts are ready for success! Take a moment to create consistent profiles for a few of the key tools you will use: Google, Canvas, GitHub, OpenAI and Slack. Then introduce yourself in your new class-specific Slack channel.

Profile Picture
You will need a photograph of your lovely face. Not your cat, pet llama, a Klingon. Not a cartoon or bitmoji. Add a nice head-shot so that we can learn your name faster and give you better feedback on assignments. Your profile picture should be identical across Google, Canvas, GitHub, and Slack.

Get Familiar with Your Online Tools
Having a Google account will allow you to easily sign up and log in to other accounts.

Canvas is an online Learning Management System (LMS) that lets you submit and track all assignments.

GitHub is the online place to store your code and collaborate with other developers using the Git version control system.

Slack is a nice chat program that will let you communicate directly with classmates, instructors, and TAs.

OpenAI is the creator of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence language model. You can ask ChatGPT questions, and have a conversation to further your understanding of concepts.

Google Setup
Do this first to make signing up for the rest of your accounts simple!

Feel free to use an existing Google account if you already have one. If you don’t, you will be able to create an account and generate a new Gmail address, or create an account with an existing email address from another provider.

Follow these steps to set up a personal Google account. Keep your username and password somewhere safe.

Canvas Setup
When you complete your course enrollment, you will get an email inviting you to join Canvas for this course. Follow the instructions in the email to get connected.

Please take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with Canvas. Start by watching this Canvas overview video (5 min). Pro Tip: Then just poke around and explore a little, especially if you haven’t used an LMS before.

Once you’ve gotten the hang of it, there are a few key settings that are important for you to adjust right away.

In the nav column at the left, click Account. Open the Settings page from there. Then, click on the Edit Settings button on the right. Make sure your timezone is set correctly.
Add your complete name, and other full contact information. Please include backup email (if you have one), and a phone number (useful in case of emergency).
Add your profile picture. Remember, use the same image as GitHub and Slack!
Click on Notifications and make sure everything is set to ASAP. Because of the compressed time frame of this course we’ve found this is the best way to ensure you get notice of changes.
Github Setup
If you already have a GitHub account, Great! Complete any remaining steps.

Go to GitHub.com.
Sign up for a free account.
Let us know a bit about about yourself by setting up your profile section. Display your full name, as it will appear on your resume.
Add your profile picture. Remember, use the same image as Canvas and Slack!
Pro Tip: Keep GitHub Presentable
Make sure you are following best practices with your GitHub account to impress any potential employers who view it.

Follow this individual workshop to learn the expectations for your account.

Share a link to your profile, and invite your classmates to “star” your best repos, or follow you if they’d like.

OpenAI Setup

Slack Setup
