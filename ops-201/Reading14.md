How to remove malware from your Windows PC

What are the main differences between antivirus and anti-malware software?

- Antivirus software is specifically designed to detect and remove viruses, which are a type of malware that can replicate themselves and spread to other computers. Antivirus software typically uses a combination of methods to detect viruses, including signature-based detection, heuristic analysis, and behavioral analysis.
- Anti-malware software is a broader term that encompasses all types of software that is designed to protect your computer from malicious software, including viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware, and ransomware. Anti-malware software typically uses a variety of detection methods, including signature-based detection, heuristic analysis, behavioral analysis, and sandboxing.


What are some signs or symptoms that may indicate a malware infection on your PC?
Explain the difference between a full system scan and a quick scan when using anti malware software.

- Your computer is running slowly or erratically. Malware can consume a lot of system resources, which can cause your computer to slow down or even crash.
- You see unusual pop-ups or error messages. Malware can often display fake error messages or pop-ups in an attempt to trick you into downloading more malware or revealing personal information.
- Your browser settings have changed without your permission. Malware can sometimes change your browser settings, such as your homepage or default search engine.
- A full system scan will scan all of the files and folders on your computer for malware. This type of scan is the most comprehensive, but it can also take the longest to complete.
- A quick scan will only scan the most common areas on your computer for malware. This type of scan is faster than a full system scan, but it is not as comprehensive.


What should you do if your computer is infected with ransomware?

- Disconnect your computer from the internet and any other networks. This will prevent the ransomware from spreading to other computers and from contacting the attacker's servers.
- Identify the type of ransomware that you have been infected with. This will help you to determine if there is a decryption tool available. You can use a tool such as No More Ransom to identify the type of ransomware that you have been infected with.
- If a decryption tool is available, use it to decrypt your files. Be careful not to download decryption tools from untrusted sources, as these tools may be malicious.
- If a decryption tool is not available, you may need to restore your computer from a backup. Make sure that your backup is from a time before you were infected with the ransomware.

Compare and contrast malware removal techniques in Windows PCs with those in other operating systems like macOS or Linux. How might these different approaches reflect the cultural values and priorities of the technology users?

- Using anti-malware software: Anti-malware software can scan your computer for malware and remove it. There are many different anti-malware software programs available, both free and paid.
- Running a system scan: Windows has a built-in system scan tool that can scan your computer for malware. To run a system scan, open Control Panel and go to Security and Maintenance > System Scan.
- Booting into Safe Mode: Safe Mode is a special mode of Windows that starts with only the essential services and drivers running. This can be useful for removing malware that is difficult to remove in normal Windows mode. To boot into Safe Mode, press the F8 key repeatedly while your computer is booting up.
- Restoring your computer from a backup: If your computer is infected with malware and you are unable to remove it, you may need to restore your computer from a backup. Make sure that your backup is from a time before you were infected with the malware.

- Using anti-malware software: There are a number of anti-malware software programs available for macOS, both free and paid.
- Running a system scan: macOS has a built-in system scan tool called XProtect. XProtect scans your computer for malware and removes it automatically. To run a manual system scan, open System Preferences and go to Security & Privacy > XProtect.
- Booting into Safe Mode: Safe Mode on macOS is similar to Safe Mode on Windows. To boot into Safe Mode on macOS, hold the Shift key while your computer is booting up.
- Restoring your computer from a backup: Similar to Windows, if your computer is infected with malware and you are unable to remove it, you may need to restore your computer from a backup. Make sure that your backup is from a time before you were infected with the malware.
