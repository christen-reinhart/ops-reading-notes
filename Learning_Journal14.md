## Learning Journal 14

## Today I Learned

One of the most effective tools in adult learning is reflection. By writing coherent summaries of lessons learned, we cement that learning and deepen our understanding of a subject. It also helps us to measure our progress.

You should probably only spend about 10-15 minutes on this assignment, although if you would find it helpful to invest more time, you are welcome to do so.

## Reflection

For this journal entry, no specific prompt other than to start off with “Today I learned…” or “Recently I learned…” and go from there.

Today's session delved into the dynamics of effective and ineffective leadership qualities when collaborating within groups. We explored the spectrum of positive and negative attributes that can either facilitate or impede collective efforts toward a shared objective. Furthermore, our discussion extended to the upcoming Project Week, during which we emphasized the importance of maintaining a cooperative and amicable atmosphere, echoing Roger's guidance of "Just be nice." Notably, there was reassurance offered by announcing that Lab 14 should not be a source of concern, a relief warmly received by the entire group. This prepared us for the anticipated Project Week, emphasizing the significance of fostering a harmonious work environment, and provided peace of mind by alleviating concerns related to Lab 14.
