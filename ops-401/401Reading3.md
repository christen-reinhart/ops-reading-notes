- Security and Risk Management

Consider a bank ATM that allows users to access bank account balances. What measures can the ATM incorporate to cover the principles of the CIA triad?

1. Confidentiality:
- Encrypted Communication: Protects sensitive data in transit between the ATM and bank servers.
- User Authentication: Ensures only authorized users can access accounts using PINs, biometrics, or other methods.
- Privacy Screens: Prevent unauthorized viewing of transactions.
Secure Card Handling: Safeguards card data from skimming devices.
2. Integrity:
- Transaction Logging: Provides a detailed trail for auditing and identifying potential integrity issues.
Tamper Detection: Alerts to physical or software tampering attempts.
- Data Verification: Uses checksums or hashing to ensure data hasn't been modified.
3. Availability: 
- Redundancy: Duplicates critical components to prevent downtime due to hardware failures.
- Regular Maintenance: Identifies and addresses issues before they impact availability.
- Monitoring and Alerts: Detects abnormal behavior and enables proactive measures.
- Backup Power: Maintains ATM operations during power outages.
Network Resilience: Uses reliable networks and failover mechanisms to ensure connectivity.


Name three best practices that support the CIA triad.

1. Layered Defense: Implement multiple security measures across different layers to create a comprehensive shield. This means using strong encryption alongside access controls, regular backups and redundancy for availability, and tamper detection mechanisms alongside data integrity verification. By having overlapping layers, even if one layer is compromised, others can still protect your data.
2. Least Privilege: Grant users the minimum level of access needed to perform their tasks. This minimizes the potential damage if unauthorized access occurs and reduces the amount of sensitive data exposed. Implement granular access controls, multi-factor authentication, and limit administrator privileges to further strengthen this principle.
3. Continuous Monitoring and Response: Don't just set up safeguards and call it a day. Continuously monitor your systems and data for suspicious activity, potential vulnerabilities, and security incidents. Have a well-defined incident response plan ready to act quickly and effectively should any issues arise. Regular vulnerability assessments and security audits can also help identify and address weaknesses before they are exploited.


## What are the three stages of the risk management lifecycle? What is each stage’s main goal or objective?

1. Identify:
- Main Goal: This stage focuses on pinpointing potential threats and vulnerabilities that could negatively impact your objectives.
- Activities: This may involve brainstorming sessions, using risk assessment tools, analyzing historical data, and exploring industry trends.
- Outcome: A comprehensive list of identified risks along with their initial level of likelihood and impact.
2. Assess:
- Main Goal: This stage aims to evaluate the identified risks in greater detail, understanding their severity and potential consequences.
- Activities: This involves analyzing the likelihood of each risk occurring, estimating the potential impact on your goals, and prioritizing them based on their overall significance.
- Outcome: A clear understanding of the risks' potential consequences and a prioritized list of risks to address.
3. Treat:
- Main Goal: This stage focuses on developing and implementing strategies to mitigate or eliminate the identified risks.
- Activities: This may involve selecting appropriate risk response strategies, such as avoidance, mitigation, transfer, or acceptance.   - Developing and implementing action plans, assigning resources, and monitoring progress are also crucial activities.
- Outcome: Reduced risk exposure and minimized potential negative impacts on your objectives.
