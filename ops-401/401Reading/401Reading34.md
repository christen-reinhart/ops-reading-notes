## Reading

1. What is Computer Forensics?

- A branch of forensic science that involves the investigation and analysis of digital devices and data to uncover evidence related to criminal or civil legal cases.

2. What are the main differences between computer forensics and cybersecurity?

- Computer forensics and cybersecurity, though interconnected within the overarching domain of information security, delineate distinct areas of concentration and goals.

- The principal aim of computer forensics resides in the scrutiny and analysis of digital evidence with the aim of elucidating details pertinent to a particular incident or criminal activity.

- In contrast, cybersecurity primarily concerns itself with the safeguarding of digital infrastructures, networks, and data from unauthorized access, malicious attacks, and assorted security breaches.

3. What are the six stages of a computer forensics examination?

- Identification: This phase entails delineating and determining the extent of the investigative scope, outlining the parameters within which digital evidence will be sought and analyzed.

- Preservation: Preservation constitutes a critical phase aimed at safeguarding the integrity and admissibility of digital evidence through meticulous handling and storage procedures, ensuring its authenticity and reliability remain intact.

- Collection: During this stage, forensic investigators systematically gather digital evidence from identified devices and data repositories using specialized tools and methodologies, adhering to legal and procedural guidelines.

- Examination: The examination phase encompasses a comprehensive analysis of the gathered digital evidence, employing forensic techniques and software to scrutinize data structures, metadata, and file contents, with the goal of extracting pertinent information and insights.

- Analysis: Analysis involves the systematic interpretation and synthesis of examination findings to discern patterns, relationships, and anomalies, thereby deriving meaningful conclusions regarding the nature and significance of the investigated events.

- Reporting: Reporting represents the culmination of the computer forensics process, wherein investigators document their findings, methodologies, and conclusions in a comprehensive and coherent manner, presenting a clear narrative of the investigation's outcomes for legal or administrative purposes.
