1. IBM Cloud Learn Hub - What is a Virtual Private Cloud?

- VPC is a virtualized network infrastructure in a cloud environment that allows users to create isolated and private sections within the public cloud. 

2. What are some of the key features of the VPC model?

- VPCs offer network isolation, meaning that resources within one VPC are logically separated from resources in other VPCs or the public internet.
- VPCs are designed to scale easily, allowing users to add or remove resources as needed without affecting the overall network architecture.

3. What are the three tiers that comprise the three-tier architecture model?

- Presentation Tier (User Interface Tier):
This is the top layer that interacts directly with the end user.
- Application Tier (Logic or Business Logic Tier):
The middle layer, also known as the logic tier, is responsible for processing
- Data Tier (Data Storage or Database Tier):
The bottom layer deals with data storage and retrieval.

4. Describe the differences between a VPC and a VPN to someone you know from your previous job.
