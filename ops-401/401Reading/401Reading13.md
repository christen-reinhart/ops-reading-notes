1.What are the benefits of a forward proxy?

-A forward proxy masks your original IP address from the websites you visit, making it harder for them to track your online activity and collect your personal data. This can be particularly useful when using public Wi-Fi networks.

2.Explain the differences between a forward and a reverse proxy?

-A forward proxy sits in front of clients (web browsers, applications) and intercepts their requests to external servers. A reverse proxy sits in front of one or more web servers and receives requests from external clients.

3.Explain to your manager why your organization might benefit from implementing a reverse proxy? 

-Load balancing distributes traffic for better performance. Protects web servers from direct attacks and masks IP addresses. Caching web content to reduce server load for frequently accessed resources.
