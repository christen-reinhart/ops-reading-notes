1.How would a security team benefit from implementing a SOAR solution?

-Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) refers to a set of practices and technologies designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of cybersecurity operations. It helps in creating a seamless workflow for incident response. They provide tools for analyzing and responding to security incidents, allowing security teams to take appropriate actions in a timely manner.

2.Explain how a SOAR solution fits into the Incident Response process.

-It can assist with faster response times and help lighten the burden on Cybersecurity Analysts. SOAR also helps with prioritization of incidents so analysts are not wasting their time with events that may be less important. Once something malicious is detected SOAR also is able to automate the response for faster times in the mitigation process.
