## Reading

1. What were the three commands used for the attack?

- http://169.254.169.254/iam/security-credentials
- http://169.254.169.254/iam/security-credentials/*****-WAF-Role
- CLI commands: $ aws	s3 ls / $ aws s3 sync s3://somebucket

2. What misconfiguration of AWS components allowed the attacker to access sensitive data?

- Poor security architecture design that exposed S3 buckets via AWS	WAF/EC2 instance to anyone with an IAM role.

## What are two of the AWS Governance practices that could have prevented such an attack?

- Review all access paths and	permissions from human identities or	non-human	identities. 
- Ensure each application, EC2 instance, or auto scaling group has	its own	IAM role.
