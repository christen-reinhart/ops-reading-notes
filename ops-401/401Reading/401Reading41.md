## Reading

1. How are the stages of a pen test very similar to those of the Cyber Kill Chain?

- During the planning phase, testers gather information about the target system, including its purpose, operating system, and security measures. This process is similar to how attackers gather intelligence in the Cyber Kill Chain.
Cyber Kill Chain: Attackers scout for targets, identifying vulnerabilities and weaknesses to exploit.

- Pen testers may develop custom tools or utilize existing exploits, much like attackers craft malicious payloads in the Weaponization stage. These tools are then distributed during the testing phase, mirroring the Delivery stage.
Cyber Kill Chain: Attackers create and distribute their attack tools (such as malware or phishing emails) to the target.

- Testers try to exploit vulnerabilities to gain access (Exploitation). If successful, they may install testing tools to maintain control (Installation) and execute further attacks within the system (Command and Control). These actions resemble the attacker's activities in these stages.
Cyber Kill Chain: After gaining access, attackers exploit vulnerabilities, install malware for persistence, and establish communication channels for remote control.

- In the final stage, testers perform actions that simulate an attacker's objectives, such as stealing data or disrupting operations.
Cyber Kill Chain: This is where attackers accomplish their goals, such as data exfiltration or deploying ransomware.

2. Your manager has asked you to explain the benefits of a pentest to the company’s leadership. How would you lead this conversation?

- A penetration test helps identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the company's IT infrastructure, including networks, applications, and systems.

- They provide valuable insights into the company's overall security posture. They help assess the effectiveness of existing security controls, policies, and procedures in place to protect against cyber threats. 

- By identifying and addressing vulnerabilities proactively, penetration tests help mitigate cybersecurity risks. 

- Many industries and regulatory frameworks require regular security assessments, including penetration testing, to ensure compliance with cybersecurity standards and regulations.

- Pentests simulate real-world cyber attacks, providing valuable insights into how the company's systems and teams respond to security incidents.

## Things I would like to know more about

- How to conduct a penetration test and write a proper report. From what I have seen so far the penetration tests certifications are very involved and time consuming. The reports that need to be filed for your customer are very involved as well and need to describe what you did and your findings in extensive detail in a conclusive and instructive manner. I would also like to know more about the OSINT portion and investigation prior to the actual testing and reporting.
