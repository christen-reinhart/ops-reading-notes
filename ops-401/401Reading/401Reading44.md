## Reading

1. What is Metasploit?

- Metasploit is a widely-used open-source penetration testing framework developed by Rapid7. It provides security professionals, penetration testers, and ethical hackers with a comprehensive suite of tools for conducting security assessments, identifying vulnerabilities, and simulating cyber attacks.

2. Explain what Metasploit is using non-technical terms.

- Just like a toolbox has different tools for different jobs, like hammers and screwdrivers, Metasploit has tools to find weaknesses in computer systems. It's like a locksmith testing the security of a lock.

- Metasploit helps security experts see if they can "break in" to a system, similar to how a hacker might try, but without causing any damage. It's like a security guard checking building doors and windows to see if they're locked properly.

- Think of Metasploit as a special kit for testing all the security features of a computer system, like doors and windows in a building. It helps find and fix weak spots before bad guys can take advantage of them.
