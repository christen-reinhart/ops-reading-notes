## Reading

1.Explain threat modeling using real-world non-technical examples.
- Scenario: A family wants to improve the security of their home.
- Threats: Burglary, home invasion, property damage.
- Vulnerabilities: Unlocked doors/windows, lack of alarm system, poor lighting.
- Mitigations: Installing deadbolts, security cameras, and motion sensor lights; reinforcing doors and windows; setting up a neighborhood watch program.

2. What are the four questions that can help us organize threat modeling?

- What are we building?: This question focuses on understanding the system or environment being analyzed.
- What can go wrong?: This question involves brainstorming and identifying potential threats and risks that could impact the system. 
- What are we going to do about it?: Once potential threats and vulnerabilities have been identified, this question focuses on developing mitigation strategies and countermeasures to address them.
- Did we do a good enough job?: This question involves evaluating the effectiveness of the threat modeling process and the adequacy of the mitigation strategies implemented.

3. You are the project lead for a new application. How would you explain the benefits of Threat Modeling to the rest of the team?

- Threat modeling allows us to identify security risks and vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle. By systematically analyzing potential threats and vulnerabilities, we can design and implement security controls and countermeasures to mitigate risks effectively. Security is a critical factor for our customers, and demonstrating a commitment to security can enhance their trust and confidence in our application.
