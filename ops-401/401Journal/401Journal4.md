## Learning Journal 4

Today I Learned

-One of the most effective tools in adult learning is reflection. By writing coherent summaries of lessons learned, we cement that learning and deepen our understanding of a subject. It also helps us to measure our progress.

-You should probably only spend about 10-15 minutes on this assignment, although if you would find it helpful to invest more time, you are welcome to do so.

## Reflection

-Write a brief reflection on your learning today, or use the prompt below to get started.

-“Adults need to know why to learn something; as soon as they answer this question, they are ready to start.”

-The why applies to both large-scale (learning web development as a new profession) and small-scale (learning a particular tool or technique), and your learning journal is an excellent place to identify and contemplate those whys. They are important. So… what is your why?

-The reason I want to learn is to better myself and gain a better understanding of the cybersecurity realm. This is so I can get an honest, respectable job and be a valued member of a team hopefully. I learned today the importance of being prepared and knowing course material. Making sure to read over the small things before asking questions”attention to detail”.
