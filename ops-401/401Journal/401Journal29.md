## Thinking about each of your assignments for the day, reflect on:

-Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
Do not get bogged down in written analysis; instead, focus on capturing the moment with an eye toward how your observations can guide you toward future productivity.

-I need to finish my reading and follow up with my grader on the second interview for submission of feedback.
