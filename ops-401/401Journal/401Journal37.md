## Learning Journal: Class 37

- Retrospectives are a critical part of Agile, and typically take the form of meetings held by a team at the end of a sprint cycle. To get us acclimated to that process, we will use the format of a retrospectives to guide today’s reflection.

- Take 10-15 minutes at the end of lab to respond to the following questions, adapted from the article:

1. What went well that I might forget if I don’t write it down?

- I was able to remember the majority of the OWASP top 10 and their meanings.

2. What did I learn today?

- We went over OWASP and the top ten attacks. Then went over ZEN and utilizing it to test websites.

3. What should I do differently next time?

- Get more in depth with the website testing applications when time permits.

- Pay attention to course outlines and Slack since we got ahead of ourselves with juicebox.

4. What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

- I just need to spend more time getting familiar with the different applications we are getting familiar with for a more in depth understanding.

## Thinking about each of your assignments for the day, reflect on:

1. Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

- Just followed up with my Ops-challenges needing to be graded since it is getting close to the end of the course. I need to finish reading 38 for today and go over my slide presentation.
