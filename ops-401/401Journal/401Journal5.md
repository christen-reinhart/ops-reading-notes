## Learning Journal: Class 05
Retrospectives are a critical part of Agile, and typically take the form of meetings held by a team at the end of a sprint cycle. To get us acclimated to that process, we will use the format of a retrospectives to guide today’s reflection.

## This article gives a nice overview to the role of retrospectives.

Take 10-15 minutes at the end of lab to respond to the following questions, adapted from the article:

1.What went well, that I might forget if I don’t write it down?

-I got through the day and the week just getting bogged down

2.What did I learn today?

-The difference between Hashing and encryption and how to implement them in simplistic ways.

3.What should I do differently next time?

-Voice myself more.

4.What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

-Python and Powershell

-Thinking about each of your assignments for the day, reflect on:

-Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
Do not get bogged down in written analysis; instead, focus on capturing the moment with an eye toward how your observations can guide you toward future productivity.

-Capture your thoughts in the text field below. Note that your instructor and TAs will have access to your responses here in this assignment, but that this content is not publicly visible.

-Just happy to get through the week 9 more to go.
