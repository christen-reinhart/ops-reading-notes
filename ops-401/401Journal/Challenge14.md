-Today I Learned

-One of the most effective tools in adult learning is reflection. By writing coherent summaries of lessons learned, we cement that learning and deepen our understanding of a subject. It also helps us to measure our progress.

-You should probably only spend about 10-15 minutes on this assignment, although if you would find it helpful to invest more time, you are welcome to do so.

-Networking like routing and switching comes a bit easier to me than coding like python even though they are CLI. Obviously there is a big difference between them and how they are used.

That being said I am hopeful that eventually it will start to click a bit more over time.
