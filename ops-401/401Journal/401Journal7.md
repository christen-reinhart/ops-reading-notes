## Today I Learned

One of the most effective tools in adult learning is reflection. By writing coherent summaries of lessons learned, we cement that learning and deepen our understanding of a subject. It also helps us to measure our progress.

You should probably only spend about 10-15 minutes on this assignment, although if you would find it helpful to invest more time, you are welcome to do so.

## Reflection

- Write a brief reflection on your learning today, or use the prompt below to get started.

Motivation and goals are an important part of adult learning; so is adapting to and gaining insight from things you did not anticipate. What would you say is the most unexpected part of this experience, and how have you learned from it?

- Today I learned about local encryption with bitlocker and the importance of remembering your password. I kinda forgot my password and referenced it in the wrong space, but then remembered it. It helped me to understand the difference between the code that is generated and the password you enter as a user/administrator. It has also been nice to get a little deeper into Linux CLI and have some repetition.
