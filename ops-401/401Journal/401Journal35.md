## Learning Journal: Class 35

- Retrospectives are a critical part of Agile, and typically take the form of meetings held by a team at the end of a sprint cycle. To get us acclimated to that process, we will use the format of a retrospectives to guide today’s reflection.
- This article gives a nice overview to the role of retrospectives.
- Take 10-15 minutes at the end of lab to respond to the following questions, adapted from the article:

1) What went well, that I might forget if I don’t write down?

-Successful execution of Nmap scans and interpretation of scan results.

-Understanding how to write and execute Lua scripts for Nmap.

-Exploring the benefits of adopting scripting and extensible defenses in cybersecurity operations.

2) What did I learn today?

- How to use Nmap for port scanning and vulnerability assessment.

- Writing Lua scripts for Nmap to extend its capabilities.

3) What should I do differently next time?

- Consider documenting each step of the process to track progress and reference for future tasks.

- Experiment with more advanced Nmap options and scripting techniques to deepen understanding.


4) What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

- Further exploration of advanced Nmap scripting techniques and their practical applications.

- Deeper understanding of specific vulnerabilities and their mitigation strategies in web server environments.

## Thinking about each of your assignments for the day, reflect on:

1) Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

- I need to follow up on grades for Ops Challenges that have not been graded yet.
