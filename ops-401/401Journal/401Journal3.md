## Learning Journal 3

## Today I Learned

-One of the most effective tools in adult learning is reflection. By writing coherent summaries of lessons learned, we cement that learning and deepen our understanding of a subject. It also helps us to measure our progress.

-You should probably only spend about 10-15 minutes on this assignment, although if you would find it helpful to invest more time, you are welcome to do so.

## Reflection

- Write a brief reflection on your learning today, or use the prompt below to get started.

“[Adult learners] demand that their learning is relevant to their real life issues, problems, and tasks, and that their education will boost their performance levels and help them live their lives in a better, and more satisfying way.”

-In other words, understanding your motivation for learning contributes to the effectiveness of your learning, and your learning journal is a place to explore those thoughts. What are your motivations for learning?

-My motivation for learning is to branch into cybersecurity. I will be utilizing my previous experience to expand my knowledge base with Code Fellows Cyber Ops. This is just the beginning of my journey since it seems as if college is necessary as well. My plan is to get my Bachelors in cybersecurity and then attend the SANS Institute. This is a long term goal and I am sure it is subject to change as the IT field is continuously changing.
