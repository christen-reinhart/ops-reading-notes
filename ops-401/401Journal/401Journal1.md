## Learning Journal 1

Today I Learned

One of the most effective tools in adult learning is reflection. By writing coherent summaries of lessons learned, we cement that learning and deepen our understanding of a subject. It also helps us to measure our progress.

## Andragogy vs. Pedagogy

Maybe you’ve seen a graphic similar to this before?

This is a learning style model developed by researcher David Kolb and it is a core principle in the way our curriculum is designed and our instruction is delivered at Code Fellows. Note the “Reflective Observation” component; it is that piece that is a primary differentiator between the way adults learn and the way children learn.

As an adult, learning is different for you now than it was when you were younger. Do a quick read of this article that describes the differences between andragogy (adult-focused learning) and pedagogy (child-focused learning).

Over the duration of this course there will be a series of learning journal assignments where you will be prompted to reflect on your learning. The reflection is a critical part of adult learning, and the self-awareness that results is a key component of emotional intelligence. Initially, these journal assignments will give you prompts to get you started, but as time goes by some assignments will be less structured so that you explore your thoughts with more self-determination and freedom.

## Reflection

Write a brief reflection on your learning today, or use the prompt below to get started.

Consider the following quote from the article linked above:

“[Adult learners] are deeply involved not only in planning, but also in evaluating their learning, as they know what knowledge they want to acquire.”

In other words, you should continuously evaluate your learning, and your learning journal is an excellent way to keep track of that. How do you see yourself planning and evaluating your learning? What details will you record and/or measure? How often will you evaluate what you want to learn?

## Capture your thoughts in the text field below; you will have an assignment like this each class day going forward. Note that your instructor and TAs will have access to your journal here in this assignment, but that this content is not publicly visible.

-Although a lot of what we learned today may seem somewhat unimportant, it is very important. I have been watching Mike Chapples videos for CISSP on Linkedin premium and it's the first thing he goes over as well (CIA and Governance). There are jobs that are specific to compliance, regulations and policies etc. within cybersecurity that pay very well. The amount of areas that cybersecurity and IT encompass is like the medical field. You can never know it all but you need to know enough to speak to it and know how it affects your specific job. One of the first things my friend who is in cybersecurity as a threat hunter asked me is what do you want to do? You need to pick an area or speciality(Cybersecurity Analyst) so you can start to tailor your training. This class is just the beginning of my journey in cybersecurity. I still have years of training and then continual training to keep up and branch out.
