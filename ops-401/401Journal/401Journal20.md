## Retrospective 20

- Retrospectives are a critical part of Agile, and typically take the form of meetings held by a team at the end of a sprint cycle. To get us acclimated to that process, we will use the format of a retrospectives to guide today’s reflection.

- Take 10-15 minutes at the end of lab to respond to the following questions, adapted from the article:

1. What went well that I might forget if I don’t write it down?

- Today was pretty straight forward. Our team just synced up and each of us took an administrative task while going over the requirements.

2.What did I learn today?

- Learned more about some of my classmates that I have not partnered up with yet. Also went over the project criteria and outline addressing any questions.

3. What should I do differently next time?

- Not much like I said today was pretty easy so I will just enjoy the calm before the storm which is next week.

4. What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

- AWS services and navigating through its vast resources which I will be doing next week.

## Thinking about each of your assignments for the day, reflect on:

- Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

- Just have to finish my feedback and get more familiar with the project requirements so I can hit the ground running next week.
