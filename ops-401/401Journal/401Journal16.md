## Learning Journal 16

-Today I Learned

-One of the most effective tools in adult learning is reflection. By writing coherent summaries of lessons learned, we cement that learning and deepen our understanding of a subject. It also helps us to measure our progress.

-You should probably only spend about 10-15 minutes on this assignment, although if you would find it helpful to invest more time, you are welcome to do so.

## Reflection

-For this journal entry, there is no specific prompt other than to start off with “Today I learned…” or “Recently I learned…” and go from there.

-Today I learned the hard way not to move your rockyou.txt file in your lab computer from downloads to challenge repository locally. It made it easier to access once prompted by the python code today since the path was shorter and the script seemed to run fine. The issue came afterward when I went to ACP afterward and push it to GitHub from my local machine. The file was too big and I should have known better. The conflicts started to build up after that so I deleted all the files and it just made it worse. Luckily Zach was able to help and we did patch the issue, but its not actually fixed right now.
