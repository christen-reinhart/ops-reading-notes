## Personal Retrospective

- Congrats, you and your team have made it through another intensive project experience!

- It is time to reflect on what youâ€™ve done, and how your personal contributions made a difference.

## Reflection

- Below, use the text submission box for this assignment to write on each of the following topics.

## Describe your overall satisfaction level with your project results.

1. What went well and what did not?

- The individual set up of the separate components. The Windows/Linux Server, Cloud Watch/Trail, Security hub, Lambda went well as individual components. Once we tried to tie them together for monitoring, events, triggering the lambda etc. that is where the issues started.

2. How would you compare the outcome with your vision for the project?

- Everything said I think it went well. We started with a clear vision and followed it through pretty well all things considered. Once we tried to tie it all together after setting up the Servers, SIEM, Lambda, and event triggering it was frustrating so we pivoted to Splunk. We did this for a time and got Slpink set up then followed through with the remainder of the project and demonstration.

## Briefly describe your group dynamic for the week.

- Everyone worked very well all things said. Considering we had not worked in the past for the most part and came from two different classes it went very well. Their was good chemistry and no real conflicts, everyone played their part and contributed.

1. Were there any problems that proved insoluble?

- We were unable to tie in the event trigger and the lambda response.

2. Are there any team members you would call out for particular kudos?

- I think everyone played an important part. Nathalie was a good team lead and kept everyone on the path. Scotty stepped up during the demo and took charge of that process refining it from start to finish. Andrew did really well with the most technically complicated portion which was causing the SSH event, monitoring for it and the lambda response. Eveangelina and Renona teamed up very well complementing each other working on the server, hardening technical and demonstration. 

## Describe at least one difficulty you faced during project week and how you dealt with it. This difficulty could be technical in nature, or interpersonal.

- It was particularly hard getting the agents installed on the Windows and Linux EC2 instances. After getting them installed I had to set up the role and permissions then assign it to the instances. Once this was finished and running in the background I had to figure out a way to demonstrate the service for the presentation. It worked out in the end using the RDP and powershell showing the service was running. Then utilizing the additional data going to cloud watch I was able to create a widget on the dashboard and assign a good visual representation during the demonstration.

## Describe at least one surprising success or failure you experienced during the week.

- Having issues with cloudwatch and the event causing a trigger for the lambda function.

- Nathalie was able to partially mitigate this by implementing Splunk. Through working together and just focusing on the end result and not our individual tasks I believe we were successful in that respect.

## Describe changes you would make to your personal or team process that you can incorporate into your next team effort.

- I would take more time over the weekend prior to project week to figure out the process and identify possible issues that could pop up during the week. We took the weekend off this is the second time a team I worked on decided to do this and I personally regretted it.

- If there is anything else you wish us to know when assessing your contribution to the group project, please include it. Only members of the Instructional team will read these submissions, so you may be candid.

- None at this time
