## Learning Journal: Class 13

-Today I Learned

-One of the most effective tools in adult learning is reflection. By writing coherent summaries of lessons learned, we cement that learning and deepen our understanding of a subject. It also helps us to measure our progress.

-You should probably only spend about 10-15 minutes on this assignment, although if you would find it helpful to invest more time, you are welcome to do so.

## Reflection

-Write a brief reflection on your learning today, or use the prompt below to get started.

-There’s an old saying: “Experience is what you get when you don't get what you wanted.” What strategies do you use for learning from disappointments (both big and small) so that the next experience becomes productive and positive?

-I usually try to find some kind of light in situations. If the outcome is not what I wanted or expected, I evaluate if there is anything I could have done better or if this was due to issues out of my control. What have I learned from the situation at the very least, so this will not occur again? Perhaps I surrounded myself with the wrong kind of people and made a bad decision in that respect. It could be something to do with me, and I need to work harder or smarter. The most important thing is that you still learn from your failures and recognize the reality of the situation. Most successful people learn more from failures than successes, and you are not pushing yourself if you always succeed, or you are really just that good, lol.
