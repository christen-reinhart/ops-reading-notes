## Career: Class 28: Workshop #4 Prep - Behavioral Questions

### Behavioral Interview Prep
- Preparing for answers to common behavioral questions early is a MUST, because you WILL be asked these types of questions in the interview process. Your preparation is a vital step in becoming the lead candidate for any role. Your answers need development and curation time as muscle memory wins under stress. The more you practice and receive feedback, the better you sound when sharing your experiences.
## Highlight Positive Results
- NOTE: Behavioral questions that involve tension situations (e.g. tell me a time when you worked with someone difficult, when did you make a mistake, or when did you disagree) should always have a good outcome. Never tell a story about an experience where you leave the interviewer thinking that someone was marginalized by you or a group. Instead, you want the interviewer to know that you handled a difficult situation and everyone lived happily ever after. Luckily, you get to choose the situation you will talk about!

## Question 1: Tell me about a time when you had to handle a situation with a disgruntled employee.
- Situation: In my previous role, one of my team members became increasingly disgruntled due to feeling undervalued and overworked, resulting in decreased productivity and team morale.
- Task: As their supervisor, it was crucial for me to address the situation promptly and effectively to prevent further negative impact on the team's dynamics and performance.
- Action: I scheduled a private meeting with the disgruntled employee to discuss their concerns in a supportive and non-confrontational manner. I actively listened to their grievances, empathized with their feelings, and acknowledged the validity of their concerns. I encouraged open communication and transparency, assuring them that their feedback was valued and would be taken seriously. Together, we identified specific issues contributing to their dissatisfaction and collaboratively brainstormed potential solutions.
- Result: Through open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving, I was able to address the employee's concerns, restore their confidence, and rebuild trust. I implemented changes based on their feedback, such as adjusting workload distribution, providing additional support or resources, and recognizing their contributions more openly. As a result, the disgruntled employee demonstrated improved morale, increased engagement, and a renewed commitment to their work. The positive resolution of this situation also had a ripple effect on team morale, fostering a more positive and supportive work environment overall.


## Question 2: Tell me about a time when you faced personal challenges outside of work and managed to maintain your work ethic and performance.
- Situation: During a particularly difficult period in my personal life, I experienced a significant loss in my family, which deeply affected me emotionally and mentally.
- Task: Despite grappling with grief and personal struggles, I recognized the importance of maintaining professionalism and high performance at work.
- Action: I proactively sought support from friends, family, and professional counselors to cope with my personal challenges outside of work. I prioritized self-care activities such as exercise, meditation, and journaling to manage stress and maintain my mental well-being. Additionally, I communicated transparently with my supervisor and colleagues about my situation, setting realistic expectations regarding my workload and deadlines. I also developed strategies to compartmentalize my personal issues while at work, focusing on tasks at hand and staying present in meetings and collaborations.
- Result: Despite the adversity I faced in my personal life, I remained committed to upholding my work ethic and performance standards. By seeking support, practicing self-care, and maintaining open communication with my team, I was able to navigate through the challenges without compromising the quality of my work. Ultimately, my ability to effectively manage personal struggles while maintaining professionalism and productivity demonstrated my resilience, adaptability, and dedication to my responsibilities at work.


## Question 3: Tell me about a time when you had to collaborate with a difficult team member.
- Situation: In a cross-functional project, I was assigned to work closely with a team member who had a reputation for being uncooperative and resistant to feedback.
- Task: Despite the challenges presented by this team member, it was essential to find a way to collaborate effectively to achieve our project goals.
- Action: I initiated a one-on-one meeting with the team members to discuss our working relationship and understand their concerns. I actively listened to their perspective, validated their feelings, and emphasized our shared objectives. I also suggested establishing clear communication channels, setting mutual expectations, and finding common ground to build trust and rapport.
- Result: By approaching the situation with empathy and patience, I was able to establish a more positive working relationship with the difficult team member. We developed a better understanding of each other's strengths and preferences, which enabled us to collaborate more effectively on the project. As a result, we were able to overcome obstacles, meet project deadlines, and deliver high-quality work as a team. This experience taught me the importance of communication, empathy, and conflict resolution skills in fostering productive collaborations.
