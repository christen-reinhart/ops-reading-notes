## Learning Journal: Class 28

### Retrospective

- Retrospectives are a critical part of Agile, and typically take the form of meetings held by a team at the end of a sprint cycle. To get us acclimated to that process, we will use the format of a retrospectives to guide today’s reflection.

- Take 10-15 minutes at the end of lab to respond to the following questions, adapted from the article:

1. What went well that I might forget if I don’t write it down?
- I was able to get Splunk to capture aggregated data from the windows 10 VM properly. This was due to the fact that multiple individuals have been working on this over the last day or so.

2. What did I learn today?
- Just to be patient and not let your emotions get the best of you. Try not to take things personally which is not always easy. I also learned how to better utilize MITRE to understand attacks.

3. What should I do differently next time?
- Pay more attention during the demonstration. It's one thing I don't like about virtual learning is how easily you can become distracted and disengaged.

4. What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?
- I need more experience with Splunk and using indexes to isolate the sources of attacks.

## Thinking about each of your assignments for the day, reflect on:

1. Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

- I need to study more for my CompTIA test and finish reading 29 then relax and watch a movie.

- Do not get bogged down in written analysis; instead, focus on capturing the moment with an eye toward how your observations can guide you toward future productivity.

- Capture your thoughts in the text field below. Note that your instructor and TAs will have access to your responses here in this assignment, but that this content is not publicly visible.
