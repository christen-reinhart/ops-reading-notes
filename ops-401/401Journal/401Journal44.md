## Learning Journal: Class 44

- Retrospectives are a critical part of Agile, and typically take the form of meetings held by a team at the end of a sprint cycle. To get us acclimated to that process, we will use the format of a retrospectives to guide today’s reflection.

1. What went well that I might forget if I don’t write it down?

- We went over the outline for project week and some of the expectations.

2. What did I learn today?

- We went over penetration testing and what was expected for the lab today. I used the reading to perform various attacks using Metasploit.

3. What should I do differently next time?

- I should have asked a few more questions pertaining to project week.

4. What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

- I need to get more hands on with Metasploit.

## Thinking about each of your assignments for the day, reflect on:

1. Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

- I still have a few assignments to go back over and try to get additional points.
