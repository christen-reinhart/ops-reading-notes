## Learning Journal 11

-One of the most effective tools in adult learning is reflection. By writing coherent summaries of lessons learned, we cement that learning and deepen our understanding of a subject. It also helps us to measure our progress.

-You should probably only spend about 10-15 minutes on this assignment, although if you would find it helpful to invest more time, you are welcome to do so.

## Reflection

-Write a brief reflection on your learning today, or use the prompt below to get started.

-Read this short article on Imposter Syndrome. On a scale from 1 (least) to 10 (most), to what extent do you experience these feelings? Have you always felt the way you do now? If you have successfully lowered the number youâ€™d use to rate your Imposter Syndrome, how have you done so?

-On a scale of 1 to 10 I would say about a 4 give or take. Not necessarily that I think I am acting like something I am not. I just don't really think much of my technical skills and tend to low ball or discount myself. I can usually figure out technology it's just some of the more advanced situations. It can just be hard for me to have a firm understanding of technology, especially coding.
