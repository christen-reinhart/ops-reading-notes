## Learning Journal: Class 30

### Retrospective

- Retrospectives are a critical part of Agile, and typically take the form of meetings held by a team at the end of a sprint cycle. To get us acclimated to that process, we will use the format of a retrospectives to guide today’s reflection.

- This article gives a nice overview of the role of retrospectives.

- Take 10-15 minutes at the end of lab to respond to the following questions, adapted from the article:

1. What went well that I might forget if I don’t write it down?

- Today we mostly performed mock interviews and the technical part was limited except for the Challenge.

2. What did I learn today?

- Was able to reflect and gain perspective on the interview process through being interviewed and interviewing others.

3. What should I do differently next time?

- Pay more attention during the challenge demonstration. It was a bit limited and most of us were ready to start the weekend after a long week.

4. What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

- It is still hard to retain some of the information since it seems like more is getting piled on everyday.

## Thinking about each of your assignments for the day, reflect on:

1. Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

- I still have to resubmit lab 29 since I was a little confused on how to use the threat mitigation tool.
