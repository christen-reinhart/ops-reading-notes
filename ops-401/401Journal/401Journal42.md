## Learning Journal: Class 42

- Retrospectives are a critical part of Agile, and typically take the form of meetings held by a team at the end of a sprint cycle. To get us acclimated to that process, we will use the format of a retrospectives to guide today’s reflection.

- This article gives a nice overview of the role of retrospectives.

1. What went well that I might forget if I don’t write it down?

- I was able to get my interview done while not falling behind on my class work.

2. What did I learn today?

- Learning about "pass the hash" and similar attack techniques.

3. What should I do differently next time?

- Study more questions and follow along with class demos a bit more, but can only do one thing at a time.

4. What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

- Need to go back to this lab and ops challenge when I get some more time.

## Thinking about each of your assignments for the day, reflect on:

5. Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

- My reading 43 needs to be finished and I need to go back over the previous challenge and lab since I had to prioritize studying today for the interview.
