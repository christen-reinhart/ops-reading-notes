## Learning Journal: Class 43

- Retrospectives are a critical part of Agile, and typically take the form of meetings held by a team at the end of a sprint cycle. To get us acclimated to that process, we will use the format of a retrospectives to guide today’s reflection.

1. What went well that I might forget if I don’t write it down?

- The Ettercap ARP exercise went well. I just need more time to work with the application to get familiar with the tool.

2. What did I learn today?

- We learned more about Kerberous and how it works for authentication in enterprise networks. We then went over a demo for Ettercap and how to use the application to manipulate ARP tables.

3. What should I do differently next time?

- Take more time and notes to assist in the lab 43 for later reference.

4. What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

- I still need to look into Kerberous and how it functions for network authentication and SSO.

## Thinking about each of your assignments for the day, reflect on:

5. Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

- I need to finish up some final touches for Lab 43 and get reading 44 finished.
