## Learning Journal: Class 40

- Retrospectives are a critical part of Agile, and typically take the form of meetings held by a team at the end of a sprint cycle. To get us acclimated to that process, we will use the format of a retrospectives to guide todayâ€™s reflection.

- Take 10-15 minutes at the end of lab to respond to the following questions, adapted from the article:

1. What did I learn today?

- Today we went over the Ops Challenge and how to install and set up Nessus. We then reviewed the previous labs from earlier this week ZAP, Burp etc. After that we performed presentations for feedback and submission.

2. What should I do differently next time?

- I need to study more for my interview which has been scheduled for Tuesday.

3. What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

- I still have some additional work to do with Nessus since I did have some issues with Web App scanning.

## Thinking about each of your assignments for the day, reflect on:

1. Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

- Like I mentioned above I still need to prepare for my final interview. Then I will work on the reading for Monday.
