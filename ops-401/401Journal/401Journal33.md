## Learning Journal: Class 33

- Retrospectives are a critical part of Agile, and typically take the form of meetings held by a team at the end of a sprint cycle. To get us acclimated to that process, we will use the format of a retrospectives to guide today’s reflection.

- This article gives a nice overview of the role of retrospectives.

- Take 10-15 minutes at the end of lab to respond to the following questions, adapted from the article:

1. What went well that I might forget if I don’t write it down?

- The Challenge 33 went well. I was just a little confused on how the 3 major components came together and once the TA explained it to me I was just over thinking the Lab.

2. What did I learn today?

- I learned about virustotal and how to move a file in order to check it for malware using code from github.

3. What should I do differently next time?

- Pay more attention during the demo. I find it easy to get distracted by learning virtually.

4. What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

- Lab 33 was very extensive and a lot to take in at once. I enjoyed the fact that once I ironed out issues with wireshark it went very smoothly. The lab was very detailed and in depth but encompassed so much at once so it was a lot to remember. 

## Thinking about each of your assignments for the day, reflect on:

1. Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

- I just have to finish reading 34 and that is about it then study for CompTIA Cloud + a bit.
