## Retrospective 26

- Retrospectives are a critical part of Agile, and typically take the form of meetings held by a team at the end of a sprint cycle. To get us acclimated to that process, we will use the format of a retrospectives to guide today’s reflection.

## This article gives a nice overview of the role of retrospectives.

- Take 10-15 minutes at the end of lab to respond to the following questions, adapted from the article:

1. What went well, that I might forget if I don’t write it down?

- I didn't have to install the VMs except for Splunk. I still had my lab built.

2. What did I learn today?

- Everything that can go wrong did go wrong and I still have more to go back over.

3. What should I do differently next time?

- I may wait to install the actual .iso files for the lab instead of using the existing server and additional recommended files.

4. What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

- Coding is still hard for me to grasp at times.

## Thinking about each of your assignments for the day, reflect on:

- Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
Do not get bogged down in written analysis; instead, focus on capturing the moment with an eye toward how your observations can guide you toward future productivity.

- Today was rough. The lab did not go very well and I have to go back to address the code.
