## Learning Journal: Class 15

-Retrospective

-Retrospectives are a critical part of Agile, and typically take the form of meetings held by a team at the end of a sprint cycle. To get us acclimated to that process, we will use the format of a retrospectives to guide today’s reflection.

-This article gives a nice overview of the role of retrospectives.

-Take 10-15 minutes at the end of lab to respond to the following questions, adapted from the article:

## What went well, that I might forget if I don’t write it down?

- Getting familiar with using Splunk and how to better narrow down your searches

## What did I learn today?

- How to network in my search for a job and the importance of negotiation.

## What should I do differently next time?

- Take more notes during the Splunk training and get more repetition in.

## What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

- How to set up parameters for monitoring in Splunk and tiles in the dashboard.

-Capture your thoughts in the text field below. Note that your instructor and TAs will have access to your responses here in this assignment, but that this content is not publicly visible.

- This week went relatively well. I still have some make-up work I need to do over the weekend.
I want to get some more hands on with Splunk and review some of the videos. I would also like to do some reading in my new book for CISSP.
