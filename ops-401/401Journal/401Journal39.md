## Learning Journal: Class 39

- Retrospectives are a critical part of Agile, and typically take the form of meetings held by a team at the end of a sprint cycle. To get us acclimated to that process, we will use the format of a retrospectives to guide todayâ€™s reflection.

- Take 10-15 minutes at the end of lab to respond to the following questions, adapted from the article:

1. What did I learn today?

- We went over the expectations for the upcoming weeks and the final interview mostly. We reviewed lab 38 in part and went over today's lab with Web Goat and SQL injection and how databases are structured.

2. What should I do differently next time?

- Start reviewing the final interview questions and related topics sooner.

3. What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

- Pretty much the same as yesterday just using the various tools Burp, web goat and getting more familiar with them.

## Thinking about each of your assignments for the day, reflect on:

1. Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

- I need to finish the ops challenge 39 interview and start studying for the interview next week.
