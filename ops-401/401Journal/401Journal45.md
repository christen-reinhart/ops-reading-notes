## Learning Journal: Class 45

- Retrospectives are a critical part of Agile, and typically take the form of meetings held by a team at the end of a sprint cycle. To get us acclimated to that process, we will use the format of a retrospectives to guide today’s reflection.

1. What went well that I might forget if I don’t write it down?

- Was able to get all the administrative documents done pretty quickly since have done it a couple of times now.

2. What did I learn today?

- We went over project guidelines a bit and then got to verifying individual login with Marco.

3. What should I do differently next time?

- Just ask more questions during the demo and verify my login while Marco is still around for questions.

4. What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

- How things will end up coming together and play out next week but I guess that is normal.

## Thinking about each of your assignments for the day, reflect on:

1. Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

- We are just getting started since we are a blue team and will be working over the weekend.
