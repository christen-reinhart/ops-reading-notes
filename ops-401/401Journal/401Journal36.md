## Learning Journal: Class 36

- Retrospectives are a critical part of Agile, and typically take the form of meetings held by a team at the end of a sprint cycle. To get us acclimated to that process, we will use the format of a retrospectives to guide today’s reflection.

- Take 10-15 minutes at the end of lab to respond to the following questions, adapted from the article:

1) What went well that I might forget if I don’t write it down?

- The Ops-Challenge went relatively well so I went over it just for better understanding.

2) What did I learn today?

- We learned more about the OWASP top ten attacks and XSS various attacks as well.

3) What should I do differently next time?

- Just need to pay more attention during the demonstration and maybe take notes.

4) What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

- I need to read more about the top 10 OWASP attacks and become familiar with them.

## Thinking about each of your assignments for the day, reflect on:

1) Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

- I just need to follow up on my ops-challenges since a few have yet to be graded and do reading 37.
