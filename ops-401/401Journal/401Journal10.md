## Learning Journal: Class 10 Retrospective

Retrospectives are a critical part of Agile, and typically take the form of meetings held by a team at the end of a sprint cycle. To get us acclimated to that process, we will use the format of a retrospectives to guide today’s reflection.

## This article gives a nice overview to the role of retrospectives.

Take 10-15 minutes at the end of lab to respond to the following questions, adapted from the article:

1.What went well that I might forget if I don’t write it down?

-I got through the week with some issues but none major that I can tell.

2.What did I learn today?

	-Basic collection and analysis and collection of logs. This is in preparation for Slunk next week which I am looking forward to.

3.What should I do differently next time?

-Take a more step by step issue to solving my coding/ python assignments.

4.What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

-Work more on my Python/coding skills which I will do over the weekend.

## Thinking about each of your assignments for the day, reflect on:

-Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

-I will be working on Ops Challenge 6, 7 since those Python scripts need work over the weekend.
