## Learning Journal: Class 27

-Retrospectives are a critical part of Agile, and typically take the form of meetings held by a team at the end of a sprint cycle. To get us acclimated to that process, we will use the format of a retrospectives to guide today’s reflection.

## This article gives a nice overview of the role of retrospectives.

1.What went well that I might forget if I don’t write it down?

-The lab went well today. I was able to follow along while Marco was performing the Demo.
I was also able to double back and fix challenge 26 from yesterday. That being said it seems like the first day back after a project week always seems a bit stressful to say the least. If I have learned anything it is to stay the course and keep moving forward even if it feels like you arent at the time.

2.What did I learn today?

-The Challenge was pretty cool creating a script that rolled over additional data into other files once full. Since I was able to use a previous code that would ping a IP address and check for open ports then roll that data with time stamps into a folder then multiple folders was pretty cool.

3.What should I do differently next time?

-Be patient on Mondays and stay on target.

4.What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

-The living of the land attacks and different stages of implementation.

-Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
Do not get bogged down in written analysis; instead, focus on capturing the moment with an eye toward how your observations can guide you toward future productivity.

-Capture your thoughts in the text field below. Note that your instructor and TAs will have access to your responses here in this assignment, but that this content is not publicly visible.

-I just need to do my reading for tomorrow and double back to get a better understanding of yesterday's lab. That lab seems to have caused issues for quite a few individuals and I want to make sure I have a better understanding.
