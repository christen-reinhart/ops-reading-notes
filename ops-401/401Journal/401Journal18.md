## Learning Journal 18

-Today I Learned

-One of the most effective tools in adult learning is reflection. By writing coherent summaries of lessons learned, we cement that learning and deepen our understanding of a subject. It also helps us to measure our progress.

-You should probably only spend about 10-15 minutes on this assignment, although if you would find it helpful to invest more time, you are welcome to do so.

## Reflection

-For this journal entry, there is no specific prompt other than to start off with “Today I learned…” or “Recently I learned…” and go from there.

-I learned more today about AWS and how the regions are divided up. We then moved into Cloudwatch and the process of gathering information to be deposited in a S3 bucket. CloudWatch then acts as a SIEM aggregating the data based upon parameters defined by the administrator. We talked about the importance of how we separate and prioritize the data since you cannot make everything a top priority. This would overwhelm the Analyst who has to sort through it. We didn't go much into baselines and how establishing what is normal dependent on the environment is important as well. Once we have established what is normal in a complex system then we have a comparison to work off. I watched a pretty good webinar on this and the process of establishing how we define our queries to sort through data to avoid too many false positives. That is why knowing what right looks like and establishing baselines is so important. Once that is known we can make incremental adjustments and fine tune. This is also why knowing when something has changed in the network is so important as well so we are not wasting time chasing our tail and something truly important gets overlooked.
