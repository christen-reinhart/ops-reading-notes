## Learning Journal 17

- Today I Learned

- One of the most effective tools in adult learning is reflection. By writing coherent summaries of lessons learned, we cement that learning and deepen our understanding of a subject. It also helps us to measure our progress.

- You should probably only spend about 10-15 minutes on this assignment, although if you would find it helpful to invest more time, you are welcome to do so.

## Reflection

- Write a brief reflection on your learning today, or use the prompt below to get started.

- For this one, let’s go meta: What have you learned from the process of keeping a learning journal? Consider what you have learned about learning and what you have learned about yourself.

- At this point the learning journal has been getting a bit repetitive. That being said, it is a tool and the only reason you may not be getting anything out of it is because of the way you are using it. Part of reflecting is learning from your mistakes or figuring out better ways to do things once your mind is clear. I think what I have got out of the journal today is small steps consistently over a long period of time do add up. Doing something when you don’t want to do it is important to maintain consistency and good habits along with discipline.
