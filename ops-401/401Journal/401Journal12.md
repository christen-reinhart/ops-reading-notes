## Learning Journal 12

-Today I Learned

-One of the most effective tools in adult learning is reflection. By writing coherent summaries of 

-lessons learned, we cement that learning and deepen our understanding of a subject. It also helps us to measure our progress.

-You should probably only spend about 10-15 minutes on this assignment, although if you would find it helpful to invest more time, you are welcome to do so.

## Reflection

-For this journal entry, no specific prompt other than to start off with “Today I learned…” or “Recently I learned…” and go from there.

-Today I learned how to perform searches within Splunk and how to better isolate issues using the SIEM. We discussed OSINT and how it can be used defensively and offensively. I also learned how to further develope a network scanning tool using python.
