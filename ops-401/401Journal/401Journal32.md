## Learning Journal: Class 32

- Retrospectives are a critical part of Agile, and typically take the form of meetings held by a team at the end of a sprint cycle. To get us acclimated to that process, we will use the format of a retrospectives to guide today’s reflection.

- This article gives a nice overview of the role of retrospectives.

- Take 10-15 minutes at the end of lab to respond to the following questions, adapted from the article:

1. What went well that I might forget if I don’t write it down?

- I need to work more on utilizing WireShark. After today working more in depth with WireShark I realize it is not just a tool you can use easily and it is more like Splunk. By this I mean it is a skill that develops over time and extensive experience.

2. What did I learn today?

- How to utilize WireShark in analysis for malware.

3. What should I do differently next time?

- Do more research before diving into malware analysis with WireShark it is a tedious and meticulous process.

4. What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

- I need to research in depth troubleshooting and analysis with WireShark.

## Thinking about each of your assignments for the day, reflect on:

1. Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

- I still need to complete Reading 33 and double back to complete Lab 32. I needed to take a break from the lab. I started to feel cross eyed.
