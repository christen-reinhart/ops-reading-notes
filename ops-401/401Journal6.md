## Learning Journal 6

Today I Learned

One of the most effective tools in adult learning is reflection. By writing coherent summaries of lessons learned, we cement that learning and deepen our understanding of a subject. It also helps us to measure our progress.

You should probably only spend about 10-15 minutes on this assignment, although if you would find it helpful to invest more time, you are welcome to do so.

## Reflection

Write a brief reflection on your learning today, or use the prompt below to get started.

## “What motivates adults to find time for their learning in their busy schedule? Mostly intrinsic motivators.”

In other words, adults are motivated by internal forces rather than by external expectations, and your learning journal provides an outlet for considering and noting those internal forces. Which of your internal forces for learning can you concretely identify?

My internal force is just to become the best Cybersecurity Analyst I can through training available to me. I would like to think once I get the prepper training and just do my best my career will fall into place as long as I am proactive. I have been looking into the best path within the field of cybersecurity since there are so many. I have been debating on whether to go into industrial cybersecurity with infrastructure like CISA. I have not heard many individuals talking about this speciality and I am trying to go into a field that is not too saturated within cybersecurity.
