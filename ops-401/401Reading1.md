The Ultimate Guide to SOC 2 Compliance

-How would you convince your future company to pursue SOC2 compliance?

When I was still working for the DoD we would perform Command Cyber Readiness Inspections(CCRI). These were not easy and very involved, but you need a 3rd party outside of your organization to come in and access annually. In today’s IT environment it's not a matter of if your system, information or organization will get compromised. It is a matter of when and how badly to minimize the damage from these system or information compromises. It is absolutely necessary to perform internal and external audits to minimize damage and risk. You can either be proactive and have measures and policies put in place or wait to be the subject of an attack and be an example of what not to do. You do not have to spend millions of dollars to put policies and measures into place that will save you a lot of pain in the future. There is a lot of value in being SOC 2 compliant depending on the industry you are in. Once something does occur just the amount of damage to your brand name can be enough where many businesses could not even recover. 

-What are the five SOC2 Trust Principles?

1)Privacy:
The privacy principle, added in recent updates, focuses on the collection, use, retention, disclosure, and disposal of personal information.

2)Processing Integrity:
The processing integrity principle emphasizes the reliability of system processing. Organizations must ensure that their systems are performing accurately and reliably to meet their objectives.

3)Confidentiality:
The confidentiality principle deals with the protection of sensitive information. Organizations must ensure that confidential data is protected against unauthorized access or disclosure.

4)Availability:
The availability principle focuses on ensuring that the system is available for operation and use as committed or agreed. This includes measures to prevent and address disruptions such as downtime or outages.

5)Security:
The security principle requires that the system is protected against unauthorized access (both physical and logical).








-How would you explain the three levels of the SOC2 pyramid in an analogy your friends or former colleagues would understand?

-Type 1 shows how you measure at a single point in time.

-Type 2 shows how you measure up over time and is more in depth.

At the bottom of the pyramid is the foundation upon which everything else is built “Policies” or standards and governance. From those you build your procedures and how individuals should conduct business “SOPs” etc. After you have figured out demonstrating working those policies operationally. You will get the supporting documentation of the actions showing what right looks like. This will be essentially your play book so everyone knows why they are doing something, how to do it and then document it properly for reference and archiving once a SOC 2 takes place.
