## Career: Class 32: Networking Appointments

### Networking Appointments

-Now that you have targeted your 1:1 informational coffee and event opportunity it is time to schedule them. Weekends are great for casual meetups and relaxing friendly events if weekdays and weeknights are too busy. Tip: invite your connections to your graduation day.

### Note:

-Both need to be scheduled and attended before module 8.

-It is common courtesy when asking for a 1:1 that you pay the bill. Don’t ask someone to coffee, pick their brain, and stick them with the check - not a good personal brand move.

## Assignment

-Submit the time, date, and name of your 1:1 informational and event that you scheduled.

1)I have a meeting with my mentor David Kallus `February 27th @ 1100 to talk about job opportunities and what he looks for as a hiring manager(CISO).

2)I have a meeting with my friend who is in Satellite Communications (SATCOM). He wants to talk about getting into cybersecurity and what I have done so far to assist him. This meeting is February 24th @ 1400. On Saturday I will go over to his house and help with Linkedin, VET-TEC, Resume, etc.

-Allocate 10 minutes to this assignment

-TA’s will be grading you on your submission of your 1:1 event that you scheduled.
