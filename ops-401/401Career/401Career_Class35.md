## Assignment

### You will submit the following:

- Submit the Google Doc assignment you completed in the workshop.

- Reflect on what you learned during the workshop:

1. What did you find most helpful?

- I found the feedback the most helpful. The talk after the actual interview helped me a lot along with the direct feedback. Getting to know the person and finding out what they are doing to make it in cybersecurity helps a lot. Learning from their experience and how they are trying to do things differently than I am giving me perspective. Them telling me I talk slowly and monotone and how I need to show more energy helps a lot.

2. How will you continue to practice these skills?

- I am going to take the feedback and try to rehearse my responses while still trying to remain authentic and genuine.

3. Did you bookmark these tools?

- Regarding the tools mentioned during our discussion, I appreciated learning about them and found them valuable. I haven't bookmarked them yet, but I plan to do so soon to ensure I have easy access to them as I continue to develop my skills in cybersecurity. Thank you for sharing those resources with me.
