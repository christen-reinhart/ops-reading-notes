## Career: Class 40: Workshop #6: Presentation Day

### Presentation Day

- Sharing your value to potential employers in a confident manner takes intentional practice. This assignment is designed to help you bring all of your career coaching assignments together in a cohesive way to build that self-assuredness.
## Assignment

1) Write what you discovered about yourself through giving this presentation to your classmates, by sharing one key thing that you are proud of and one way to improve.

2) Also share what resonated with you the most as a spectator, that made you feel connected to the presenter.

- One key observation was the importance of creating a professional virtual environment. Presenters who ensured a clutter-free and well-lit background, dressed appropriately, and maintained a professional demeanor throughout the presentation appeared more credible and trustworthy to potential employers. This highlighted the importance of paying attention to the virtual setup to create a positive first impression.

- Additionally, I noticed the impact of thorough preparation and rehearsal on the quality of the presentation. Presenters who were well-prepared, organized, and confident in their delivery conveyed competence and expertise in their subject matter. This emphasized the importance of dedicating sufficient time to practice and refine the presentation content and delivery, especially in a virtual format where technical issues or distractions can arise.

- Furthermore, I learned the importance of effective communication and engagement techniques in virtual presentations. Presenters who actively solicited feedback, encouraged interaction, and addressed potential questions or concerns demonstrated their commitment to engaging with the audience and fostering a collaborative dialogue, which can be crucial in impressing potential employers.


## Feedback

- Most of the feedback I received was very constructive. I need to speak up and show more energy which has been a common theme in the feedback I have received. I need to add some footnotes so I stay on topic since I did go off a bit.
