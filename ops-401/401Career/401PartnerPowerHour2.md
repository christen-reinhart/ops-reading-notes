## List a few key take-aways from this presentation.

-I liked how he started out with the assumption of security and went into the SolarWinds attack. This affected both the government and civilian sectors and was widespread. No one saw it for about 9 months. This was also during the pandemic when more people than ever were working remotely. It forced the industry to totally rethink its perspective and ways of taking care of business. I enjoyed his analogy comparing dodgeball to security; he says the person that stands still is more likely to get hit than the one that keeps moving. He then goes into MFA and zero trust, using these methods to mitigate security in a remote working environment.
