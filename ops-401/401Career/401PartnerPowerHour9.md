## Assignment

### Contribute to the discussion:

1) Share one or two ways the speaker’s information will change your approach to your career transition.

- She goes over communication under stress and how she was previously in psychotherapy. She goes over practical skills to use in the everyday work place. She goes into things that do not work and things that work. First she goes over things that do not work and you having assumptions about others even though it is kinda wrong and natural at the same time. This could cause you to act on emotions which can hinder your ability to communicate clearly and concisely. This was the case during covid19 due to communicating over text , email etc. a lot got lost in translation. Things very simple like diet or being hungry can affect you very easily and make you rub others the wrong way. When we make assumptions on how a situation will play out we can project and make things play out in a negative way that may not have otherwise.

2) List a few key take-aways from this presentation.

- Dont have presumptions and use effective communications.

- Don't be afraid to have hard conversations. Just be constructive and open minded to things that may be outside of your purview. Usually there is something that if you did know it would help you to be sympathetic or understanding.

- Be aware of body language or facial expressions.

3) Share a screenshot of your LinkedIn connection request, including a nicely worded note, sent to the speaker or someone else at their company.
