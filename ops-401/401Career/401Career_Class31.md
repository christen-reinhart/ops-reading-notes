-I meet with my mentor David Kallus every other week. We recently discussed a job interview I had with Alvarez and Marsal for a SOC Analyst position. I was under qualified for the position but, the interviewer was nice enough to refer me to Reliaquest a MSSP. I put in a resume and have followed up multiple times with phone calls to HR and recruiting with no response. I discussed this with Dave and he gave me feedback on how starting at a MSSP is common to get your foot in the door and experience. We also discussed going back to college to get my degree in cybersecurity and what that would look like.

-I recently attended the SANS Inst Cyber Threat Intelligence webinar. This was very informative and I received 8 CPEs for attending. I enjoy these webinars since they have so many amazing speakers from a lot of different backgrounds. This webinar was for threat intelligence and knowing your adversary. It dealt with identifying possible threats before they happen using OSINT. Then went into identifying possible threat actors using digital forensics and sandboxing using the evidence they may leave behind after the attack.
