## Assignment

### Contribute to the discussion:

1. Share one or two ways the speaker’s information will change your approach to your career transition.

- I will look at how I interact with individuals inside and outside of work after his discussion and experiences he shared. It was very informative on the various ways threat actors will use tools to compromise a target. The stories were easy to follow and relate to since he described real companies that I knew of like F5.

2. List a few key take-aways from this presentation.

- Randy goes into the physiological aspect of cyber threats. He did work for the FBI in counter intelligence so that did explain a lot. He leads a threat hunter team and goes into techniques that threat actors may use to infiltrate a company or get information. 


- Share a screenshot of your LinkedIn connection request, including a nicely worded note, sent to the speaker or someone else at their company.
