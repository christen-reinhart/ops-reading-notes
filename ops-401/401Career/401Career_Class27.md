## Submit a small summary of three new things you’ve learned and will be implementing in your process.

The first thing that stuck out to me is the generic cover letter bullet. I have used generic cover letters so many times it is ridiculous, but in my defense I have never performed a targeted job application for the most part. If I was applying for a major tech company I would take more time. I once sat in on a webinar trying to get individuals applying to major tech companies to pay up to $10,000 for up to 6 months of coaching to assist in preparation. I was pretty familiar with the fact that recruiters and hiring managers only look over resumes briefly. I am pretty sure my interview skills need work. I don't like talking to people I don’t know and feeling as if they are judging me when they don’t even know me. I actually have spammed people with emails or continued to apply through different recruiters to the same hiring manager to see if my resume would make its way through the process still to troll them. My most recent interview the recruiter actually told me to do your research on the company. The hiring manager will ask you related questions since he likes the company and has been with them for a long time. For salary I actually have a tendency to under bid to try and get my foot in the door. Learning about the interviewers does seem a bit creepy. What if you find out some stuff that could potentially make you lose respect for your future boss? I do need to use the STAR method more and have noticed civilian hiring managers seem to use it more that prior military. Body language I do know is important but need to work on it since so much can be said through body motions or facial expressions.
