## Assignment

### Contribute to the discussion:

1) Share one or two ways the speaker’s information will change your approach to your career transition.

- I enjoyed this video with David and how he broke into cybersecurity. This coming from someone who is now mid-level in his career and seems successful. He starts by going into how interdisciplinary cyber is and competitive even at the entry level. He then goes into easy ways to get a taste for the field and see if it is a passion since that is helpful. Factors for pay include experience, credentials, network, education etc. He does say that negotiation skills can play a big part in pay once you do get the interview and can hinder you if you are passive. At the junior level there is a high amount of competition depending on the speciality. Past the entry level the supply level of applicants drops off quite a bit.

2) List a few key take-aways from this presentation.
Keep in mind the market you work in and the level of supply for cybersecurity professionals is starting to be met as of his presentation. That being said, once you get past the entry level and set yourself apart there is a lot of opportunity. 

3) Share a screenshot of your LinkedIn connection request, including a nicely worded note, sent to the speaker or someone else at their company.
