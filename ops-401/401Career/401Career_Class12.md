## Assignment
-Submit a few paragraphs on what you selected into the assignment. Summarize the episodes you listened to how they benefited you.
-I like the Gerald Auger podcast. He is one of the connections that I have made on Linkedin. It's entertaining and he goes over the current patches, attacks, and vulnerabilities or things cyber daily in the morning. It’s kinda like a morning show for cybersecurity. Today he talked about information/PII leaked on the Darkweb from Thailand by possible hacktivists. Some of the guys I was in the service with at JCSE on Macdill AFB have a smaller podcast called “The other side or the Firewall” which I have only listened to a few times due to limited time.
