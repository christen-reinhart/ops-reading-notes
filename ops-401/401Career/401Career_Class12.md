## The Other Side of the Firewall:

- "The Other Side of the Firewall," hosted by former JCSE members at MacDill AFB, offers a unique perspective that stems from hands-on experience in the military cybersecurity domain. While the podcast may be smaller in scale, its niche focus and the background of its hosts provide a valuable insight into the challenges and strategies faced by military cybersecurity professionals.

- In summary, both podcasts bring valuable perspectives to the table.
