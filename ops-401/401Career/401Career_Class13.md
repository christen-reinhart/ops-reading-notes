## Career: Class 13: Workshop #3 Prep - Set a Networking Appointment

-Networking Appointments

-Now that you have targeted your 1:1 informational coffee and event opportunity it is time to schedule them. Weekends are great for casual meetups and relaxing friendly events if weekdays and weeknights are too busy. Tip: invite your connections to your graduation day.

## Note:

-Both need to be scheduled and attended before module 8.

-It is common courtesy when asking for a 1:1 that you pay the bill. Donâ€™t ask someone to coffee, pick their brain, and stick them with the check - not a good personal brand move.

## Assignment

-Submit the time, date, and name of your 1:1 informational and event that you scheduled.

-I will be meeting with David Kallus, my mentor from the ACP program 30JAN2024 @ 1100 EST. We will be discussing jobs, the industry, how the class is going and certifications. We will also be discussing whether I will be going back to school to seek my degree.
