## Career: Class 33: Coffee Networking Report

- Tell us what you learned from your 1:1 meeting.

## Assignment

1. For your 1:1 informational coffee, share what you learned about someone professionally, what you found out about yourself, and what you would do differently to improve upon to maximize your next meeting.

- Every meeting with my mentor, Dave, is very helpful. He has been in the field for a long time; has a very impressive resume with education and certifications. I enjoy talking to him and getting his perspective since he is very humble and truthful, so I take his feedback seriously. We have been discussing my path forward and where I should go after Code Fellows. He has recommended entry-level SOC analyst roles and getting that hands-on experience. While school is also a recommended path or option, it depends on where I see myself. He said if I want to be more technical, a degree does not matter so much. If I want to go into management and move up the ladder, a degree does come into play. We left off with that and will be meeting again in about a week.

- Allocate 20 minutes to this assignment. TA's will be grading you on your submission of your 1:1 meeting including the name of who you met and description of what you learned from the experience.
