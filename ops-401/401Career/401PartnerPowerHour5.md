## Assignment
-Contribute to the discussion:
1. Share one or two ways the speaker’s information will change your approach to your career transition.

- I like how she said she is continually putting herself out there and looking for jobs and doing interviews. The quote she presented was pretty good about good leaders not being afraid to be bold, but are thoughtful and careful in their preparation.

2. List a few key take-aways from this presentation.

- I liked the art of conversation lies in listening. She also ties in how a lot of cyber individuals come from various backgrounds and using that different perspective can be a strength. Being brave enough to speak up and just start a different kind of conversation that matters and me not be easy. It was nice how she went into a 3rd party security audit of her SOC and how it was necessary to rely on others. Finally consistency matters but you still need to be flexible. Being consistent does not really mean being stubborn as in closed minded. It means showing up consistently and putting in the work and continually trying to better yourself.

3. Share a screenshot of your LinkedIn connection request, including a nicely worded note, sent to the speaker or someone else at their company.
