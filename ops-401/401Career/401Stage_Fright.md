-Write about two things that you will implement to improve your anxiety when giving a presentation.

I am working on being better prepared by studying and attending webcasts. Additionally, I have been listening to podcasts on LinkedIn with some of my contacts to obtain current industry information. Yesterday, I listened to a live podcast while working on class assignments. The podcast featured an individual's story of how he rose in the cybersecurity industry. This experience helped me understand and learn from his journey, including some of the mistakes he made and learned from. I believe that gaining knowledge through such experiences will boost my confidence and improve my vocabulary.

To further enhance my skills, I plan to engage in more presentations and mock interviews. While I have participated in all project presentations so far, I still need to seek individual feedback from my classmates.
