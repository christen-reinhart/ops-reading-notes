## Project: Final Retro #1

- Reflect on the work you did today. Answer the following questions in as much detail as you can provide. Your answers are confidential amongst the instructional team.

1. What progress did your team make today?

- We were about to get all of the splunk forwarders working and the data/logs being pushed to Splunk. Also we set up a dashboard in splunk with the log information from the servers. We got the Cloudwatch, CloudTrail, Dashboard, Guard Duty, Security Hub, Log Groups.

2. What specific contributions did you make? Please share links to your work from today (documentation or PRs/commits).

- I set up some of the Splunk forwarders on the EC2 instances and CloudWatch, CloudTrail, Dashboard, Guard Duty, Security Hub, Log Groups etc. I started working on using cloud watch to monitor the Metasploitable EC2 Windows 2008 instance since Splunk forwarders are not compatible with older versions. I started work on the slide show and the Threat model/ STRIDE models.

3. What has been most challenging today? Your responses here are held confidential within the instructional team.

- Getting the Metasploitable monitoring working and still working on it. Snort gave us some trouble and monitoring in a limited capacity from Threat Hunter 1.
