- Went through all the logged events in GuardDuty since Splunk was having issues.
- Made a timeline for the logged events to display patterns.
- Worked on the Lambda function triggered by an event but still no resolution.
- Monitored network activity for any signs of compromise or attacks then logged incident report.
