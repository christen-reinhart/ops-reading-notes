## Reflection

- Below, use the text submission box for this assignment to write on each of the following topics.

## Describe your overall satisfaction level with your project results.

- Reflecting on the outcomes of the project, my satisfaction level is moderately high, tempered by the challenges we faced along the way. The successful resolution of technical hurdles, such as the Lambda function and the Splunk logging issue, underscores the team's resilience and adaptability. While the transition to GuardDuty was a necessary pivot, it also highlighted our ability to remain flexible under pressure and find effective solutions amid constraints. The eventual smooth operation of Splunk for our presentation was a significant achievement, although the earlier limitations somewhat constrained our use of data in the final report. Despite these obstacles, the project was a valuable learning experience, offering insights into both the technical aspects of our work and the importance of teamwork and communication. Overall, the sense of accomplishment in overcoming these challenges and delivering a functional solution contributes to a feeling of satisfaction with what we managed to achieve together.

1. What went well and what did not?

- Initially, we faced hurdles with the Lambda function but overcame these challenges to ensure its proper operation. Subsequently, our deployment of Splunk encountered difficulties as it became inundated with an excessive volume of logs, leading to its temporary inefficiency. To maintain our monitoring activities, we transitioned to using GuardDuty. Though GuardDuty served as a reliable alternative, it didn't match Splunk's comprehensive analytics capabilities. Nonetheless, we managed to rectify the issues with Splunk and had it fully operational for our presentation. Despite this success, the prior complications with Splunk restricted our ability to harness the data comprehensively in our report, impacting the overall depth and detail of our analysis.

2. How would you compare the outcome with your vision for the project?

- My initial vision for the project was centered around achieving seamless data integration and analysis through Splunk, aiming for thorough monitoring and reporting capabilities. However, the journey unveiled a series of challenges, turning into a valuable lesson on navigating the complexities of handling large datasets and the necessity of having backup plans when primary tools falter. We encountered specific difficulties with Snort, particularly in routing data from various endpoints to the threat hunter and subsequently into Splunk. The situation escalated to the point where we had to temporarily disconnect the Snort input to manage the overwhelming volume of log ingestion. Despite these obstacles, our team's resilience and commitment to open communication, primarily through regular updates and status reports shared on Slack, enabled us to surmount the difficulties and maintain progress towards our objectives.

3. Briefly describe your group dynamic for the week.

- Our team collaboration was notably effective, with a shared determination to persevere through the week and reach graduation. The atmosphere was one of mutual support rather than competition; no one was intent on causing disruptions or outperforming others. This harmonious dynamic contributed significantly to our overall productivity and morale. Additionally, our collaboration extended beyond our immediate team, as we engaged with another team facing similar challenges with Splunk. This spirit of cooperation and mutual assistance not only helped address technical issues but also reinforced the sense of community and shared goals among us.

4. Were there any problems that proved insoluble?

- Throughout the week, we encountered intermittent issues with Splunk, leading to a strategic decision before the presentation to halt logging and discontinue the Snort input. This measure aimed to reduce the volume of logs and alleviate the system's load. We resumed access to Splunk just prior to our presentation. The challenges we faced were not due to shortcomings in our management or operational errors; rather, they stemmed from restrictions related to license limits and the accumulation of log storage and archives over the week. This approach helped us navigate the limitations and ensure the system's optimal performance for the presentation.

5. Are there any team members you would call out for particular kudos?

- Over the weekend, Michael provided substantial assistance and demonstrated a strong grasp of Splunk, leveraging his experience from a previous project where Splunk was chosen for monitoring. Thierry also made significant contributions by successfully implementing a Lambda function, an area that has historically presented challenges for many. Working alongside them was a rewarding experience for me, and it was particularly gratifying to reunite with former team members who stopped by from past projects. Their involvement and the collaboration amongst us underscored the value of teamwork and diverse expertise in overcoming project hurdles.

6. Describe at least one difficulty you faced during project week and how you dealt with it. This difficulty could be technical in nature, or interpersonal.

- Facing the challenge of preparing for my final test and interview just before project week was a source of significant stress, especially after failing the 10-question quiz with a score of 6.6, which added to my frustration. In the midst of this, I consciously decided to keep my eyes on the ultimate goal, striving not to get bogged down by feelings of overwhelm. I recognized that dwelling on frustration, seeking justification for it, or blaming others would only detract from finding a solution and essentially contribute to the problem. Instead, I focused on moving forward step by step, allowing my engagement with the work to distract me from immediate concerns. After dedicating time to study and collaborate with my instructor, I managed to pass the test, realizing in retrospect that I had exaggerated the severity of the situation. This experience taught me the value of maintaining a positive outlook and continuously progressing, regardless of the obstacles encountered.

7. Describe at least one surprising success or failure you experienced during the week.

- Initially failing but ultimately passing the 10-question exit test for the final assessment left me feeling frustrated, especially since I had anticipated the test to be straightforward and the interview to be challenging. The reality, however, was quite the opposite, catching me completely off guard. This unexpected reversal of expectations significantly affected my mental state, leading me to overthink my approach and second-guess my preparation strategies. The stark contrast between what I had anticipated and what actually transpired caused a great deal of irritation. It prompted me to reflect deeply on the ways I could have approached the situation differently, highlighting the importance of adaptability in the face of unforeseen challenges.

8. Describe changes you would make to your personal or team process that you can incorporate into your next team effort.

- To enhance accountability and structure within the team, it's crucial to establish clear leadership and task assignments. This involves appointing a designated leader, regardless of their position, to oversee the process and ensure that responsibilities are distributed effectively. Additionally, maintaining focus is essential; this means requiring team members to be actively engaged in discussions, whether they're happening in person or virtually. To prevent distractions and ensure full participation, members should be present at the table, or in the case of virtual meetings, actively involved without resorting to messaging or being absent while their avatar appears active. This approach emphasizes the importance of direct communication and collaboration, ensuring that everyone is fully involved in the conversation and contributing to the solution.

9. If there is anything else you wish us to know when assessing your contribution to the group project, please include it. Only members of the Instructional team will read these submissions, so you may be candid.
