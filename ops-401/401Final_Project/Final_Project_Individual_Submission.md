## Final Project: Individual Submission

- Congrats, you and your team have made it through another intensive project experience!

- It is time to reflect on what you’ve done, and how your personal contributions made a difference.

## Reflection

- Below, use the text submission box for this assignment to write on each of the following topics.

- Describe your overall satisfaction level with your project results.

1. What went well and what did not?

- We got off to a good start with all the administrative documentation and worked over the weekend to get our environment set up and properly monitoring it by Monday.

- We had some issues with the Lambda function but eventually got it working properly.
After that Splunk got overwhelmed due to the volume of logs it was ingesting. We fell back onto GuardDuty for monitoring but it was a bit limited compared to Splunk. Eventually Splunk did start working properly for our presentation but we were limited in our ability to use the data in our report.


2. How would you compare the outcome with your vision for the project?

- My vision for the project  included a smooth integration and analysis of data using Splunk, with comprehensive monitoring and reporting. The reality, with its hurdles, presented a learning curve in managing and analyzing large volumes of data, as well as in contingency planning when primary tools do not function as expected. We also had some issues with snort and getting that data from the other endpoints to the threat hunter and then to Splunk. After that we had to take the Snort input to Splunk offline due to excessive log ingestion. In the end we overcome the hurdles through being persistent and keeping each other informed through status reports on Slack.

3. Briefly describe your group dynamic for the week.

- I would say we worked well together, I think everyone was just ready to push through this week to get to the other side and graduate. No one was looking to make any waves or try to out shine anyone else. The dynamic of the team was a good one and we still had the other team come by to work with them as well since we both had Splunk issues at one time or another.

4. Were there any problems that proved insoluble?

- The Splunk issues were on and off throughout the week. Before the presentation we just stopped logging into it and stopped the Snort input to limit the load of logs. Then logged into it right before the presentation. It wasn’t due to any issues on our end, mostly it was due to license limits and the log storage/ archive building up over the week.

5. Are there any team members you would call out for particular kudos?

- Michael helped a lot over the weekend and took on Splunk very well since his last project they went with Splunk for monitoring. Thierry did well getting the Lambda function working. Since that has been an area where people tend to have issues in the past. I enjoyed working with all of them and it was nice to have some of my old team members come by from previous projects.

6. Describe at least one difficulty you faced during project week and how you dealt with it. This difficulty could be technical in nature, or interpersonal.

- It was frustrating having to prepare for and take my final test and interview going into project week. Then I failed the 10 question quiz and got a 6.6 which was very frustrating. I just tried to focus on the end goal and not get overwhelmed. If you just start focusing on why you should be frustrated and how to justify it and how it's someone else's fault. Then you are not focusing on a solution and part of your own problem. I tried to stay focused and just put one foot in front of the other and let some of the work take my mind off of the issues at hand. I then studied and worked with my instructor a bit prior to the test and passed. I realized I was making more of the situation than needed to be and glad that I just continued to move in a positive direction. 

7. Describe at least one surprising success or failure you experienced during the week.

- Initially failing but ultimately passing the 10-question exit test for the final assessment left me feeling frustrated, especially since I had anticipated the test to be straightforward and the interview to be challenging. The reality, however, was quite the opposite, catching me completely off guard. This unexpected reversal of expectations significantly affected my mental state, leading me to overthink my approach and second-guess my preparation strategies. The stark contrast between what I had anticipated and what actually transpired caused a great deal of irritation. It prompted me to reflect deeply on the ways I could have approached the situation differently, highlighting the importance of adaptability in the face of unforeseen challenges.

8. Describe changes you would make to your personal or team process that you can incorporate into your next team effort.

- To enhance accountability and structure within the team, it's crucial to establish clear leadership and task assignments. This involves appointing a designated leader, regardless of their position, to oversee the process and ensure that responsibilities are distributed effectively. Additionally, maintaining focus is essential; this means requiring team members to be actively engaged in discussions, whether they're happening in person or virtually. To prevent distractions and ensure full participation, members should be present at the table, or in the case of virtual meetings, actively involved without resorting to messaging or being absent while their avatar appears active. This approach emphasizes the importance of direct communication and collaboration, ensuring that everyone is fully involved in the conversation and contributing to the solution.

9. If there is anything else you wish us to know when assessing your contribution to the group project, please include it. Only members of the Instructional team will read these submissions, so you may be candid.

- Most of my contributions and work can be found through the links provided below, which have been consistently included in my daily retrospective reports. Throughout the week and over the weekend, I ensured my presence both in Slack and at our discussion table, demonstrating my commitment to the project. My aim was to make a sincere effort and remain accessible to the team, ensuring that my participation was both active and productive. This consistent engagement reflects my dedication to our collective goals and my willingness to contribute effectively to our success.
