## Learning Journal 2

## Today I Learned

One of the most effective tools in adult learning is reflection. By writing coherent summaries of lessons learned, we cement that learning and deepen our understanding of a subject. It also helps us to measure our progress.

You should probably only spend about 10-15 minutes on this assignment, although if you would find it helpful to invest more time, you are welcome to do so.

## Reflection

##Write a brief reflection on your learning today, or use the prompt below to get started.

“For adult learners, their experience becomes the main resource of both their learning and the personal identity they have developed, as the richer and more diverse their experience, the more the diversity they can bring to their own learning.”

##In other words, your life experience in learning the things you did before learning code will make this new experience more meaningful for you, and reflection on all of your experiences is essential in maximizing what you can gain from your study at Code Fellows. How do you think your prior life and professional experience will help you in this new endeavor?

I come from an IT background, but not necessarily coding or cybersecurity for that matter. I think that since I do have some IT experience it will help me in my cybersecurity journey. That being said, it has been a while since I have gone to school and virtual learning is new to me. I think that since I am older I appreciate the learning experience more now than I did when I was younger. Having been a civilian and working for 10 years then joining the army and now going to school while being older is kinda funny to me since I am doing things in reverse.
