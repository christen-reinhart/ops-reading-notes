1)Explain the levels of abstraction in AWS to someone without a technical background.

-Abstraction is just making something complicated simple by using key values to explain it.
Depending on the different services you use provided by Amazon there are varying levels of abstraction. For some customers especially small businesses they don't need to get into weeds on different complexities involved in the services rendered. On the other hand some customers like developers need more specific complex services due to the nature of their business. Amazon, trying to appeal to a broad customer base, offers many different services within a large scope and many of these can be tailored to the customer.


2)What are the control plane and data plane responsible for in container abstraction?

-The data plane is pretty simple; it provides the hardware to perform the tasks. This includes CPU, RAM, Storage Etc.

-The control plane manages the group of containers telling them how to start up and what to do while they are running. Hence the name “Orchestration Layer” it guides and instructs the containers on what to do and how to do it.

3)Where does AWS Lambda fall in the layers of abstraction and what makes it so special?

-AWS Lambda sits at a high level of abstraction, providing a serverless computing environment. Lambda allows you to run code in response to events without provisioning or managing servers.
