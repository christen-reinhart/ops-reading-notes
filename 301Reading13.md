## Reading

## What is Active Directory?

-Active Directory (AD) acts like the central hub managing all the employees, resources, and security. It's a directory service developed by Microsoft that helps manage users, computers, and other objects in a Windows network.

## What exactly is “Active Directory” and are the key services it provides?

-Centralized user management: Create, manage, and grant access to user accounts and resources.
-Authentication and authorization: Verify user identities and control access to resources.
-Group Policy management: Apply consistent settings and configurations to groups of users and computers.
-Resource sharing: Share printers, files, applications, and other resources across the network.
-Directory search: Easily find users, computers, groups, and other objects based on their attributes.


## What are the differences between a domain, forest, and tree in Active Directory?

-Domain: A logical grouping of objects (users, computers) that share a common security boundary and administration.
-Forest: A collection of one or more domains that share a common schema, configuration, and global catalog.
-Tree: A hierarchical structure within a forest, consisting of domains and their child domains.


## How can objects (e.g. users, devices) within a domain be grouped?

-Organizational Units (OUs): Organize objects based on function, department, or location.
-Security Groups: Assign permissions and restrictions to groups of users.
-Distribution Groups: Send emails or messages to a group of users.


## Explain the benefits of Active Directory, as you would to a family member.

-Centralized management: Control everything from one place, saving time and effort.
-Enhanced security: Granular access controls prevent unauthorized access to resources.
-Improved efficiency: Streamline user management and resource sharing.
-Scalability: Easily accommodate a growing number of users and devices.
