## How to Use System Restore

1. What is the purpose of the Windows System Restore tool?

One of the primary purposes of System Restore is to help users recover data and  their system from software-related problems. If you make changes to your system, such as installing a problematic driver or software, and it leads to issues like performance problems or crashes, System Restore enables you to undo those changes. In some cases, malware or viruses can infect your system and cause damage. System Restore can help in recovering your system to a state before the infection occurred, removing the malicious changes made by the malware.

2. How long does it usually take to use the System Restore tool in Windows?

Creating a restore point is usually a quick process and should only take a few minutes.The time it takes to restore your system to a specific restore point can vary. In many cases, it's a relatively fast process, typically taking 20-30 minutes. Your computer may need to be rebooted one or more times during the restore and update process, which can add to the overall time.

3. How do you start a System Restore from the command prompt?

Access the Command Prompt:
Press Win + R to open the "Run" dialog.
Type cmd and press Enter to open the Command Prompt with administrator privileges. You'll need administrator rights to perform System Restore.
Run System Restore Command:
In the Command Prompt window, type the following command:
Bash 
rstrui.exe
Press Enter.
After running the command, the System Restore wizard should appear on your screen.

4. What options are available if System Restore did not fix the problem?

If you have multiple restore points, try using a different one. Ensure your Windows operating system is up-to-date by checking for and installing the latest Windows updates.  If the issue started after installing new software or drivers, consider uninstalling those recent installations. 

It is important to perform data backups in-order to maintain the integrity and availability of the information your business requires to perform day to day business.

## What is Bash?

1. What is the primary function of a shell in a computer’s operating system? 

Shells allow users to interact with the operating system by entering text commands. They provide a means for users to write scripts or batch files. Shells provide commands for creating, copying, moving, deleting, and managing files and directories.
2. How does Bash locate and execute commands on a Linux or Unix system? 

It locates and executes commands on a Linux or Unix system through a process known as command execution. Bash reads the command from the input provided by the user. Then it parses the command line to understand what command you want to execute. 

3. How can you determine if your system is running a Bash shell?

Type “echo” if your system is using Bash as the default shell, it will typically display "/bin/bash" or a similar path to the Bash shell executable. This command shows the name of the currently running shell. You can check the version of the Bash shell by typing “--version”.
4. What makes Bash scripting powerful and why is it considered scriptable?

It is widely available on Unix like operating systems. Allows you to execute system commands and utilities directly from the script. Bash scripts can use variables to store and manipulate data. 
5. Bash scripting allows for customization, automation, and efficiency. Discuss methods or practices from your previous work experience or cultural background that aim to achieve similar goals in daily tasks. 

Standard Operating Procedures (SOP’s) in my previous occupation(US Army) we used SOP’s all the time, SOPs are established to document and standardize processes, ensuring consistency and efficiency in daily operations.

The reason this topic is important to know is to understand the underlying systems that run and automate processes.
