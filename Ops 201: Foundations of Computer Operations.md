## How to Use System Restore

1. What is the purpose of the Windows System Restore tool?

One of the primary purposes of System Restore is to help users recover data and  their system from software-related problems. If you make changes to your system, such as installing a problematic driver or software, and it leads to issues like performance problems or crashes, System Restore enables you to undo those changes. In some cases, malware or viruses can infect your system and cause damage. System Restore can help in recovering your system to a state before the infection occurred, removing the malicious changes made by the malware.

2. How long does it usually take to use the System Restore tool in Windows?

Creating a restore point is usually a quick process and should only take a few minutes.The time it takes to restore your system to a specific restore point can vary. In many cases, it's a relatively fast process, typically taking 20-30 minutes. Your computer may need to be rebooted one or more times during the restore and update process, which can add to the overall time.

3. How do you start a System Restore from the command prompt?

Access the Command Prompt:
Press Win + R to open the "Run" dialog.
Type cmd and press Enter to open the Command Prompt with administrator privileges. You'll need administrator rights to perform System Restore.
Run System Restore Command:
In the Command Prompt window, type the following command:
Bash 
rstrui.exe
Press Enter.
After running the command, the System Restore wizard should appear on your screen.

4. What options are available if System Restore did not fix the problem?

If you have multiple restore points, try using a different one. Ensure your Windows operating system is up-to-date by checking for and installing the latest Windows updates.  If the issue started after installing new software or drivers, consider uninstalling those recent installations. 

It is important to perform data backups in-order to maintain the integrity and availability of the information your business requires to perform day to day business.
