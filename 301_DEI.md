Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding

## What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

-Rise of personal computers in homes: Many early home computers were marketed towards boys and young men, creating an early exposure gap.
-Limited female role models in tech: A lack of visible female figures in computer science likely discouraged girls from pursuing the field.
-Stereotypes and gender bias: Societal stereotypes associating technology with masculinity likely contributed to a less welcoming environment for women.

## Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

-Male students who grew up playing on computers gained valuable technical skills and familiarity that female students lacked.

-This early exposure could have fostered a greater sense of confidence and comfort in pursuing computer science as a career path.


## Review the data: Employee breakdown of key technology companies

-Analyzing employee breakdowns of key technology companies can reveal the underrepresentation of women in leadership and technical roles.


-This lack of diversity can limit the perspectives and experiences considered in product development and decision-making.


## Ask the question: Why diversity matters to your tech company
-Diverse teams bring together different perspectives and experiences, leading to more innovative ideas and solutions.

-A diverse workforce can better understand and serve the needs of a diverse user base, leading to more successful and impactful products and services.


## When are diversity efforts most successful?

-Diversity initiatives are most effective when they go beyond simply hiring diverse individuals and actively create an inclusive culture where everyone feels valued and respected.

-This includes providing opportunities for growth and development, addressing unconscious biases, and fostering a sense of belonging for all employees.


## Why do diverse companies perform better?

-Diverse companies perform better because they can tap into a wider talent pool, bringing in individuals with unique skills and perspectives.

## Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

-Diversity ensures that the app's features, language, and design are culturally sensitive and considerate of diverse health practices and beliefs. This approach makes the app more accessible and appealing to a broader range of users.
