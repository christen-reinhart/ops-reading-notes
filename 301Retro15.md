## Retrospective 15

Retrospectives are a critical part of Agile, and typically take the form of meetings held by a team at the end of a sprint cycle. To get us acclimated to that process, we will use the format of a retrospectives to guide today’s reflection.

This article gives a nice overview of the role of retrospectives.

Take 10-15 minutes at the end of lab to respond to the following questions, adapted from the article:

## What went well that I might forget if I don’t write it down?

-Not much to forget today since most of the class work was changed and the 301 team projects were prioritized.

## What did I learn today?

-Working well with others to come to a common agreement and move forward.

## What should I do differently next time?

-Read through the project requirements more to gain a better understanding of what is expected.

## What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

-How to divide up this project properly in an equal manner that utilizes everyone to the best of their ability.

## Thinking about each of your assignments for the day, reflect on:

Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

-A lot is coming up with project week so I don't even know where to start. I will just start to get my feet wet with the tasks that have been assigned to me and go from there.
