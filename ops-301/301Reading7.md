## Reading

-What is NGINX?
NGINX (pronounced "engine-ex") is a high-performance open-source web server and reverse proxy that can also be used as a load balancer, mail proxy, and HTTP cache. It is known for its efficiency, scalability, and portability, making it a popular choice for powering high-traffic websites and applications.


-What are some common use cases for NGINX?
Web serving: Serving static content and dynamic content generated by web applications.
Reverse proxying: Acting as an intermediary between clients and other servers, distributing traffic, and providing security measures.
Load balancing: Distributing incoming requests across multiple servers to improve performance and availability.
Mail proxying: Routing and filtering incoming and outgoing email traffic.
HTTP caching: Storing frequently accessed content to reduce response times and improve network efficiency.


-How does NGINX handle tasks that could slow down the web server?
Event-driven architecture: NGINX uses a non-blocking, event-driven architecture, allowing it to handle multiple connections simultaneously without consuming excessive CPU resources.
Efficient memory management: NGINX employs memory pools and other efficient memory management techniques to minimize memory usage and optimize performance.
Asynchronous I/O: NGINX utilizes asynchronous I/O operations to handle network requests efficiently, allowing it to process multiple requests while waiting for responses.
Modular design: NGINX's modular design enables the addition of third-party modules to enhance its functionality and address specific needs.



-Describe, as if to a non-technical friend, how to actually pronounce “NGINX”, and why an org might choose to use it.
The pronunciation of "engine" and add an "ex" at the end. That's how NGINX is pronounced.
Performance: NGINX's event-driven architecture and efficient memory management make it a high-performance web server.
Scalability: NGINX can handle large traffic volumes and can be easily scaled up to meet growing demands.
Reliability: NGINX is known for its stability and robustness, making it a reliable choice for powering mission-critical applications.
Flexibility: NGINX's modular design and wide range of modules make it a versatile tool that can be adapted to various needs.

## Things I want to know more about

What is meant by asynchronous I/O? I have read about this and had some test questions while preparing for Network+. I assume it is multitasking Input and Outputs in a way that doesn't overload processing power.
