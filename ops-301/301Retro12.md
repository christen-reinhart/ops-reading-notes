## Retrospective 12


Retrospectives are a critical part of Agile, and typically take the form of meetings held by a team at the end of a sprint cycle. To get us acclimated to that process, we will use the format of a retrospectives to guide today’s reflection.

This article gives a nice overview of the role of retrospectives.

Take 10-15 minutes at the end of lab to respond to the following questions, adapted from the article:

## What went well that I might forget if I don’t write it down?

-The Domain Controller and the DNS Server loaded ok and the lab went well today. I made sure to document this well since I have only done this once before years ago.

## What did I learn today?

-The theory behind setting up a domain in an enterprise network. Then actually going through the motions and implementing a DC and DNS server..

## What should I do differently next time?

-Pay more attention during the demo. I did lose track a few times due to my processor CPU being slow. Also better allocate my CPU processing power so it does not lag so much.

## What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

-I need to Work on my scripting.

## Thinking about each of your assignments for the day, reflect on:

## Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

-Everything is pretty much good for today. I just need to go over the Ops Challenge for a better understanding.
