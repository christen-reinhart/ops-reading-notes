## Retrospective 11

Retrospectives are a critical part of Agile, and typically take the form of meetings held by a team at the end of a sprint cycle. To get us acclimated to that process, we will use the format of a retrospectives to guide today’s reflection.

This article gives a nice overview of the role of retrospectives.

Take 10-15 minutes at the end of lab to respond to the following questions, adapted from the article:

## What went well that I might forget if I don’t write it down?

-Setting up the windows server and windows explorer since servers aren't really made to surf the internet. Making sure to use the standard evaluation desktop experience so it doesn't start up in the CLI.

## What did I learn today?

-The different ways to tackle problems and how the waterfall method is basically obsolete.
How to install a server and set aside IP addresses for the DHCP pool for the server in pfsense.


## What should I do differently next time?

-Read the directions first that tell you how to install the server first.


## What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

-The more I learn the more I realize how much I don't know.

Thinking about each of your assignments for the day, reflect on:

## Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

-Reading 12 and studying more about python now that I have some more time after my family left.
