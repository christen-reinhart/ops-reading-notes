## Retrospective6

Retrospectives are a critical part of Agile, and typically take the form of meetings held by a team at the end of a sprint cycle. To get us acclimated to that process, we will use the format of a retrospectives to guide today’s reflection.

## This article gives a nice overview of the role of retrospectives.

Take 10-15 minutes at the end of lab to respond to the following questions, adapted from the article:

What went well that I might forget if I don’t write it down?
I figured out with some help from the TA’s how to set up the virtual IP address to make the NAT assignment work. It was kinda confusing knowing what IP addresses to use in the portion that Marco did the demo on. I made sure to take plenty of screen shots for future reference since it takes a couple of repetitions for me to remember the process.

-What did I learn today?
How to set up NAT using PFsense and the fundamentals of Python. We went over how Python is similar to Bash but uses a more friendly syntax.

-What should I do differently next time?
Pay more attention during the demo and don't be afraid to ask for help

-What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?
I understand the idea and theory behind NAt but I need to learn more about implementing it.

Thinking about each of your assignments for the day, reflect on:

-Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
Just have to do tomorrow's reading and study some more for Network+.
