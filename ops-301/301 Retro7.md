Retrospective 7

Retrospectives are a critical part of Agile, and typically take the form of meetings held by a team at the end of a sprint cycle. To get us acclimated to that process, we will use the format of a retrospectives to guide today’s reflection.

This article gives a nice overview of the role of retrospectives.

Take 10-15 minutes at the end of lab to respond to the following questions, adapted from the article:

-What went well, that I might forget if I don’t write it down?

The lab went relatively well. I loaded the server before class so I could follow along better. I also have been making sure to pay attention to the memory in my lab computer since I learned that the hard way.

-What did I learn today?
Reviewed NAT and bit more and related it to PAT which helped with some additional clarity. Enjoyed setting up the basic web server and firewall rules in PFsense. 

-What should I do differently next time?
Read through the instructions a little bit better before asking for help.

-What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?
I am working on scripting and reading through the in depth descriptions. It is just kinda difficult to prioritize since the large majority of my focus is going to Network + like I mentioned earlier.

-Thinking about each of your assignments for the day, reflect on:

-Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
Just my reading for tomorrow then Network + studying and Python.
