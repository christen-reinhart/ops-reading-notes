## Retrospective

Retrospectives are a critical part of Agile, and typically take the form of meetings held by a team at the end of a sprint cycle. To get us acclimated to that process, we will use the format of a retrospectives to guide today’s reflection.

This article gives a nice overview of the role of retrospectives.

Take 10-15 minutes at the end of lab to respond to the following questions, adapted from the article:

## What went well that I might forget if I don’t write it down?

-How to set up a group policy within an active directory and apply it to a user.

## What did I learn today?

-How to set up group policy and why it is important on enterprise type networks for security and standardization. How to analyze code in depth which I have been trying to do more of, but it was nice to have it as part of a assignment.

## What should I do differently next time?

-Pay more attention during the demo more I started to get pretty tired.

## What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

-Navigating in active directory, there is so much to it and you can make a mistake so easily.

## Thinking about each of your assignments for the day, reflect on:

## Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

-My reading and following up on the meet up for coffee to discuss cybersecurity. I added a note since I have not forgotten to do the assignment.
