Ragù, often referred to as a ragout sauce, is a rich and flavorful meat sauce that is used in Italian cuisine, typically served with pasta. Here's a basic recipe for making a traditional Bolognese-style ragù sauce:
Ingredients:
1 pound (450g) ground beef
1/2 pound (225g) ground pork
1/2 pound (225g) ground veal (or you can use all beef if preferred)
1 medium onion, finely chopped
1 celery stalk, finely chopped
1 carrot, finely chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup (120ml) dry white wine
1 cup (240ml) whole milk
1 can (28 ounces or 800g) crushed tomatoes
1/2 cup (120ml) beef or chicken broth
2 tablespoons tomato paste
2 tablespoons olive oil
Salt and pepper to taste
A pinch of nutmeg
A pinch of red pepper flakes (optional)
Fresh basil or parsley for garnish
Grated Parmesan cheese for serving
Instructions:
In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, celery, and carrot. Sauté until the vegetables are softened and the onion is translucent, which should take about 5-7 minutes.
Add the minced garlic and sauté for an additional minute.
Increase the heat to medium-high, and add the ground beef, pork, and veal. Cook the meat, breaking it up with a spoon, until it's browned and any liquid has evaporated.
Pour in the white wine and simmer for a few minutes until the alcohol has cooked off.
Reduce the heat to medium and add the milk. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until the milk has almost completely evaporated.
Stir in the tomato paste and cook for a couple of minutes, allowing it to deepen in color and flavor.
Add the crushed tomatoes, broth, nutmeg, red pepper flakes (if using), salt, and pepper. Stir to combine.
Reduce the heat to low, partially cover the pot, and simmer the sauce for at least 3 hours, stirring occasionally. You can simmer it for longer for even better flavor. Add more broth or water if it becomes too thick during cooking.
Taste and adjust the seasonings as needed.
Serve the ragù sauce over your favorite cooked pasta, such as fettuccine, pappardelle, or tagliatelle. Garnish with fresh basil or parsley, and offer grated Parmesan cheese at the table.
This traditional ragù sauce is a labor of love, but it's incredibly rich and delicious. You can also use it as a filling for lasagna or serve it with polenta. Enjoy!

Google Bard answer:


Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, chopped
1 carrot, chopped
1 celery stalk, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound ground beef
1/2 cup dry red wine (optional)
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional)
Instructions:
Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion, carrot, and celery and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more.
Add the ground beef to the pot and cook until browned. Drain off any excess grease.
Add the red wine to the pot (if using) and cook until evaporated.
Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, oregano, thyme, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for at least 1 hour, or up to 3 hours.
Stir in the Parmesan cheese (if using) and serve over pasta.
Tips:
For a richer flavor, use a combination of ground beef and ground pork.
If you don't have red wine, you can substitute beef broth or water.
To make the sauce ahead of time, cook it for 1 hour, then let it cool completely. Store the sauce in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months. When you're ready to serve, thaw the sauce in the refrigerator overnight and then reheat it over low heat.
Serve the ragout sauce with your favorite pasta, such as spaghetti, fettuccine, or rigatoni.
Enjoy!

Teach me a new scale on the guitar.

Certainly! Let's learn a new scale on the guitar. We'll explore the A Minor Pentatonic Scale, a versatile and widely used scale in various styles of music, including rock, blues, and pop. This scale is relatively easy for beginners and provides a great foundation for soloing and improvisation.
Here's how to play the A Minor Pentatonic Scale:
Step 1: Understand the Fretboard
Before we start, let's get familiar with the names of the open strings on the guitar. Starting from the thickest string (low E) to the thinnest string (high E), they are E, A, D, G, B, and E.
Step 2: Learn the Scale Pattern
We'll use the "box" pattern for the A Minor Pentatonic Scale. Place your fingers as follows:
Index finger (1st finger) on the 5th fret of the low E string (A note).
Pinky finger (4th finger) on the 8th fret of the low E string (E note).
Now, follow this pattern for the rest of the scale:
A string: 5th fret (A note) and 7th fret (C note).
D string: 5th fret (D note) and 7th fret (E note).
G string: 5th fret (G note) and 7th fret (A note).
B string: 5th fret (C note) and 8th fret (E note).
High E string: 5th fret (A note) and 8th fret (E note).
Step 3: Play the Scale
Now, you can start playing the scale by picking each note in sequence. The numbers represent your fingers:
Low E string: 1 - 4
A string: 1 - 3
D string: 1 - 3
G string: 1 - 3
B string: 1 - 4
High E string: 1 - 4
Practice going up and down the scale until you're comfortable with the finger positions and can play it smoothly.
Step 4: Experiment and Create
Once you're familiar with the scale, start experimenting with it. You can use this scale to create guitar solos or licks in various musical contexts. Try bending notes, using slides, and incorporating different rhythms to make your playing more expressive and interesting.
Remember, practice is key. Spend time working on this scale and incorporating it into your playing. Over time, you'll be able to use it for improvisation and creating your own melodies.
Feel free to ask if you have any questions or if you'd like to learn more about guitar playing!

Changing the oil in your car is an essential maintenance task that helps keep your engine running smoothly. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to change the oil in your car:
Tools and Materials:
New engine oil (Check your car's manual for the recommended oil type and quantity.)
Oil filter
Oil filter wrench
Wrench or socket set
Oil drain pan
Funnel
Oil filter gasket (if necessary)
Jack and jack stands or car ramps
Gloves and safety goggles
Oil filter removal tool (if the filter is difficult to remove)
Oil filter disposal container (for recycling)
Step-by-Step Guide:
Safety Precautions:
Park your car on a level surface.
Ensure the engine is cool, not hot.
Use safety goggles and gloves to protect your eyes and skin.
If you need to lift your car, use car ramps or a jack and jack stands, and ensure it's safely supported.
Locate the Oil Drain Plug:
Consult your car's manual to find the location of the oil drain plug under the engine.
Warm Up the Engine:
Start your car and run it for a few minutes to warm up the oil. Warm oil flows more easily, making it easier to drain.
Place the Oil Drain Pan:
Position the oil drain pan under the oil drain plug.
Drain the Old Oil:
Use a wrench or socket set to loosen and remove the oil drain plug. Be cautious as the oil may be hot.
Allow the old oil to drain completely into the pan.
Inspect the drain plug for any damage or excessive wear. Replace it if necessary.
Replace the Oil Filter:
Use an oil filter wrench to remove the old oil filter. If it's difficult to remove, you can use an oil filter removal tool.
Before attaching the new filter, apply a small amount of new oil to the rubber gasket of the new filter. This helps create a better seal.
Screw on the new oil filter by hand. It should be tightened until it makes contact with the engine, then give it an additional 3/4 to 1 turn.
Add New Oil:
Use a funnel to pour the new engine oil into the oil filler cap on the top of the engine. Refer to your car's manual for the recommended oil quantity.
Wait a minute for the oil to settle, then check the oil level using the dipstick. Add more oil if needed.
Dispose of Old Oil and Filter:
Properly dispose of the old oil and filter. Many auto parts stores or recycling centers accept used oil for recycling.
Check for Leaks:
After the oil change, start the engine and let it run for a minute. Check for any oil leaks around the drain plug and oil filter. If you find leaks, turn off the engine and recheck the tightness of the drain plug and oil filter.
Record the Oil Change:
Keep a record of the date and mileage at which you changed the oil. This helps you keep track of your car's maintenance schedule.
Changing the oil in your car is a crucial task for engine health and longevity. If you're not comfortable doing this yourself, it's a service that many auto repair shops and quick oil change facilities offer.
