This is important since the Window 10 file we loaded onto VirtualBox was a ISO file format and we need to load it using a virtual drive.

What is an ISO File?  International Organization for Standardization file is a file stored in a format that represents the contents of a CD, DVD, Blur-Ray Disc. ISO files are typically stored in the ISO 9660 file system format. 

How do you write an ISO file to a CD, DVD, or removable media (like a thumb drive)?
Insert the USB thumb drive into a USB port on your computer.
Download and install a USB bootable creation tool if you don't have one already. Popular tools include "Rufus" for Windows or "dd" for Linux. For macOS, you can use the built-in "Disk Utility" application.
Open the USB bootable creation tool.
Select the ISO file you want to write to the USB drive.
Configure the tool settings, such as the USB drive to use, partition scheme (e.g., MBR or GPT), and file system format (e.g., FAT32 or NTFS).
Start the process. The tool will create a bootable USB drive using the ISO file.
Once the process is complete, safely eject the USB drive.

How do you create an ISO file? Their are various programs you can use to create ISO files from a CD Disc.

How do you mount an ISO file? It is tricking you computer into opening a ISO file like a CD usually using a emulator and virtual drive.

Things I want to know?
I am very intersted in learning more about virtual machines the way they work and how to implement them.
