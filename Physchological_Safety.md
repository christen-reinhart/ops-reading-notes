## Discussion Questions

What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?

Open Communication: Teams that encourage open and honest communication create an environment where members feel comfortable sharing their thoughts, ideas, concerns, and feedback without fear of retribution or judgment. This promotes the free exchange of ideas, problem-solving, and constructive discussions, which are essential for team cohesion and productivity.
Trust and Respect: Trust and respect are foundational to psychological safety. When team members trust one another and have mutual respect, they are more likely to support each other, take risks, and admit mistakes without the fear of humiliation or blame. Building trust often involves demonstrating consistency, reliability, and integrity in all interactions.
Inclusive Leadership: Leadership plays a crucial role in creating a psychologically safe team. Inclusive leaders actively listen to team members, value diverse perspectives, and ensure that everyone's contributions are acknowledged and respected. Inclusive leaders also set clear expectations for behavior and actively address any disruptive or disrespectful conduct within the team.


Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.

I endured a toxic work environment characterized by self-serving leadership that prioritized personal career advancement over the well-being of the team. Trust and consistency were notably absent in our daily interactions, creating a challenging and demoralizing atmosphere.

What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members? 
When team members feel safe to voice their opinions and concerns, they are more likely to actively participate and contribute their best efforts. Teams that feel psychologically safe are more effective at addressing challenges and resolving conflicts. A psychologically safe environment reduces stress and anxiety among team members. Trust is the cornerstone of psychological safety, and when trust is present, collaboration flourishes.
