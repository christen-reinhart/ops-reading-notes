## Reading


What is a site-to-site VPN?
A site-to-site VPN works by encapsulating data packets in encrypted tunnels. This ensures that only authorized users can access the data, even if it travels over the public Internet. The encryption process is typically handled by specialized VPN devices, such as routers or firewalls.

What is TCP/IP and what is it used for?
TCP/IP, which stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. It provides a standardized framework for data communication and facilitates the exchange of data between computers and networks. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) ensures reliable and ordered delivery of data, while IP (Internet Protocol) is responsible for the addressing and routing of data packets across networks. 

What are some popular reasons for using a VPN?
Security and Privacy: VPNs encrypt internet traffic, providing a secure and private connection, particularly when using public Wi-Fi networks.
Remote Access: VPNs allow users to access their organization's network remotely, enhancing flexibility for employees working from different locations.
Bypassing Geo-restrictions: VPNs can be used to access content that may be restricted or blocked based on geographical location.
Anonymous Browsing: VPNs can mask the user's IP address, enhancing anonymity while browsing the internet.


Explain the difference between the three types of VPNs.
Remote Access VPN: Connects individual users to a private network, such as a corporate network, from a remote location.
Site-to-Site VPN: Connects two or more private networks over the Internet.
MPLS VPN: Uses Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) technology to create a highly secure and scalable site-to-site VPN.
